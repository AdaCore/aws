	* soap-message-xml.adb:
	(Parse_Param): Detect object without type. Workaround a problem
	 with interoperability with IIS server using WSDL and not providing
	 the type into the payload. All such type are just encoded as
	 XML_String objects. First part of the fix for a bug reported by
	 Wiljan Derks.
	Add node name to error message.
	Minor reformatting.

	* soap-message.adb:
	(XML_Image): Rename NL to New_Line. Do not indent here the payload
	 wrapper. This is now properly done into SOAP.Types.

	* soap-types.adb:
	(XML_Indent): Thread safe counter used to indent XML payload.
	(Spaces): New routine.
	(XML_Image): All version, use XML_Indent to properly indent the
	 XML payload. Easier to read.
	(Array_Type): Same_Type is false if we have composite type (Record
	 or Array) into the Array. Second part of the fix for a bug
	 reported by Wiljan Derks.
