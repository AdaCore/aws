To run the testsuite with N jobs in parallel and to show error messages,
run:

./testsuite.py -j N --diff

All results are stored in the 'out' directory by default.

To run only the 0001_turl tests:

./testsuite.py -j N --diff 0001_turl

A report is created in out/report.

See ./testsuite.py -h for more help

a test.out

The test.py should start with:

"from test_support import *"
