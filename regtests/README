AWS Testsuite
=============

You'll need GNATPython to run the testsuite.
To use it:

git clone https://forge.open-do.org/anonscm/git/gnatpython/gnatpython.git

Then install it in your python distribution (./setup.py install) or
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/gnatpython and compile
gnatpython/src/rlimit/rlimit.c (or rlimit-NT.c if you are on a windows machine)
and add it to your PATH.

Before running the testsuite, you need to run 'make setup' in AWS
root directory.

To run the testsuite with N jobs in parallel and to show error messages,
run:

./testsuite.py -j N --diff

All results are stored in the 'out' directory by default.

To run only the 0001_turl tests:

./testsuite.py -j N --diff 0001_turl

A report is created in out/report.

See ./testsuite.py -h for more help

How to add a new test
=====================

To add a new test, create a new directory xxx_name with a test.py and
a test.out

The test.py should start with:

"from test_support import *"

then you can use all test_support.py functions.
