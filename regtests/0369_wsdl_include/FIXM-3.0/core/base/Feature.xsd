            The Feature type is the parent of all FIXM complex types that describe physical 
            objects or events. 
             
            It is used as a marker to messaging and other tools that the contained information 
            is 
            to be treated as an unit and not further decomposed. 
             
            Feature carries information about the ultimate source of its contained data 
            in the "Provenance" attribute group. Implicitly, this information qualifies all the 
            
            contained elements, unless one of them overrides it locally. 
             
            It is expected that applications will use this to record their own meta-data about 
            the information contained in the feature.

            Provenance carries four attributes that describe the ultimate source of the data

            * source - The source of the data in the message (unstructured, for archival analysis).
