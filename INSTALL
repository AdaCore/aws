Building a release
------------------

The static AWS libraries are always built. The shared libraries are built
by default if the platform supports them (this is automatically detected).

If you have not installed XML/Ada in the standard directory and plan to build
AWS with SOAP support you must be sure that ADA_PROJECT_PATH points to the
XML/Ada projects. See XML/Ada documentation.

Then to build AWS:

   $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/AdaCore/aws
   $ cd aws
   $ make setup build install

For information about all possible settings, look at make's variables in
makefile.conf.

Note that you can find more information about the build procedure in the AWS
User's Guide.

This release requires an Ada compiler supporting some Ada 2012 features. It
is possible to build this release starting with the following compilers:

        GNAT Pro 7.4.2

        GNAT GPL 2016 Edition

To build the documentation in HTML, PDF and plain text formats you need to
have a working Sphinx package installed on your system.

   $ make build-doc

Building on Windows
-------------------

On Windows, you can build from the standard Windows command line using the
provided scripts win32\build.cmd. The argument is the path where AWS is to be
installed. It is recommended to install AWS with the compiler, so for example:

   c:> win32\build.cmd c:\gnat\2016

An alternative is to install either the Cygwin or MSYS toolset. In this case
the procedure described above using 'make' can be used.
