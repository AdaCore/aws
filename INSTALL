Building a release
------------------

To build AWS you need to change some settings in the top level 
makefile.conf file.

You also need to set ADA_PROJECT_PATH to at least point to .build/projects,
you also need to set it properly if you use XML/Ada for example.

   $ export ADA_PROJECT_PATH=<aws_root>/.build/projects

Look for ADASOCKETS, XMLADA, ASIS, POSIX, and INSTALL make's
variables. Then building AWS is as simple as:

   $ make setup build install

Note that you can find more information about the build procedure into
the AWS User's Guide.



				       
Building from CVS
-----------------

If you got the AWS sources from CVS you'll also need to check out the
Templates_Parser module:

   $ cd AWS
   $ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@libre.adacore.com:/anoncvs co templates_parser
