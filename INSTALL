Building a release
------------------

To build AWS you need to change some settings in the top level 
makefile.conf file.

If you have XML/Ada installed and plan to build AWS with SOAP support you must
be sure that ADA_PROJECT_PATH point to the XML/Ada projects. See XML/Ada
documentation.

Look for ADASOCKETS, ASIS, POSIX, and INSTALL make's variables. Then building
AWS is as simple as:

   $ make setup build install

Note that you can find more information about the build procedure into
the AWS User's Guide.



				       
Building from CVS
-----------------

If you got the AWS sources from CVS you'll need to adjust the
templates_parser/templates_parser.gpr file to build with XML/Ada support.
For now this needs to be done manually. If you have XML/Ada installed you
can uncomment the 'with "xmlada";' line.
