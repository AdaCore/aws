Building a release
------------------

To build AWS you need to change some settings in the top level 
makefile.conf file.

If you have not installed XML/Ada into the standard directory and plan to
build AWS with SOAP support you must be sure that ADA_PROJECT_PATH point to
the XML/Ada projects. See XML/Ada documentation.

Look for ADASOCKETS, ASIS, POSIX, and INSTALL make's variables. Then building
AWS is as simple as:

   $ make setup build install

Note that you can find more information about the build procedure into
the AWS User's Guide.

This release requires an Ada compiler supporting some Ada 2005 features as it
is using the Ada.Containers libraries. It is possible to build this release
using the following compilers :

	GNAT Pro 5.04w
	GNAT GAP 2005 Edition
	GNAT GPL 2005 Edition


Building from CVS
-----------------

If you are using GNAT GPL 2005 Edition or GNAT GAP 2005 Edition you need to
apply the patch found in support/gnat-2005-editions.dif.

To run the templates_parser's non-regression tests with XML/Ada support, you
need to uncomment the 'with "xmlada";' line in templates_parser.gpr project
file.


To build the documentation in HTML, PDF, PostScript, INFO and plain text
format you need to have a working makeinfo and Tex package installed on
your system.

   $ make build_doc


Building on Windows
-------------------

On Windows based system you need to install either the Cygwin or MSYS
toolset. This is required as the build procedure uses some UNIX tools.
