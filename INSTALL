Building a release
------------------

To build AWS you need to change some settings in the top level 
makefile.conf file.

If you have not installed XML/Ada into the standard directory and plan to
build AWS with SOAP support you must be sure that ADA_PROJECT_PATH point to
the XML/Ada projects. See XML/Ada documentation.

Look for ADASOCKETS, ASIS, POSIX, and INSTALL make's variables. Then building
AWS is as simple as:

   $ make setup build install

Note that you can find more information about the build procedure into
the AWS User's Guide.

This release requires an Ada compiler supporting some Ada 2005 features as it
is using the Ada.Containers libraries. It is possible to build this release
using the following compilers :

	GNAT Pro 5.04w
	GNAT GAP 2005 Edition
	GNAT GPL 2005 Edition


Building from CVS
-----------------

If you got the AWS sources from CVS you'll need to adjust the
templates_parser/templates_parser.gpr file to build with XML/Ada support.
For now this needs to be done manually. If you have XML/Ada installed you
can uncomment the 'with "xmlada";' line.
