Building a release
------------------

The static AWS libraries are always built, the shared libraries are built
by default if the plate-form support them (this is automatically detected).

If you have not installed XML/Ada into the standard directory and plan to
build AWS with SOAP support you must be sure that ADA_PROJECT_PATH point to
the XML/Ada projects. See XML/Ada documentation.

Then building AWS is as simple as:

   $ make setup build install

For information about all possible settings, look make's variables in
makefile.conf.

Note that you can find more information about the build procedure into
the AWS User's Guide.

This release requires an Ada compiler supporting some Ada 2012 features. It
is possible to build this release starting with the following compilers:

        GNAT Pro 7.2.2

        GNAT GPL 2014 Edition

To build with GNAT GPL 2014 in debug mode you need to apply the following
patch:

   $ git apply workspace/gpl-2014.dif

To build the documentation in HTML, PDF and plain text formats you need to
have a working Sphinx package installed on your system.

   $ make build-doc

Building on Windows
-------------------

On Windows based system you need to install either the Cygwin or MSYS
toolset. This is required as the build procedure uses some UNIX tools.
