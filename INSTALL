To build AWS you need to change some settings in the top level 
makefile.conf file.

Look for ADASOCKETS, XMLADA, ASIS, POSIX, and INSTALL make's
variables. Then doing a "make build" and "make install" should be ok.

Note that you can find more information about the build procedure into
the AWS User's Guide.
