To build AWS you need to change some settings in the top level 
makefile.conf file.

Look for ADASOCKETS, XMLADA, ASIS, POSIX, and INSTALL make's
variables. Then building AWS is as simple as:

	$ make setup build install

Note that you can find more information about the build procedure into
the AWS User's Guide.
