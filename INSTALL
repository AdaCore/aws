To build AWS you need to change some settings in the main makefile (the 
makefile found on this directory).

Look for ADASOCKETS, XMLADA, v_XMLADA and INSTALL make's variables.
Then doing a "make build" should be ok.

Note that you can find more information about the build procedure into AWS
User's Guide.
