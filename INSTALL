Building a release
------------------

To build AWS you need to change some settings in the top level
makefile.conf file.

If you have not installed XML/Ada into the standard directory and plan to
build AWS with SOAP support you must be sure that ADA_PROJECT_PATH point to
the XML/Ada projects. See XML/Ada documentation.

Look for SOCKET, ASIS, XMLADA, LDAP and INSTALL make's variables.
Then building AWS is as simple as:

   $ make setup build install

Note that you can find more information about the build procedure into
the AWS User's Guide.

This release requires an Ada compiler supporting some Ada 2005 features as it
is using the Ada.Containers libraries. It is possible to build this release
using the following compilers :

	GNAT Pro 5.04a1
	GNAT GPL 2006 Edition

Building from CVS
-----------------

To run the templates_parser's non-regression tests with XML/Ada support, you
need to uncomment the 'with "aws_xmlada";' line in templates_parser.gpr
project file.

To build the documentation in HTML, PDF, PostScript, INFO and plain text
format you need to have a working makeinfo and Tex package installed on
your system.

   $ make build_doc

Building on Windows
-------------------

On Windows based system you need to install either the Cygwin or MSYS
toolset. This is required as the build procedure uses some UNIX tools.
