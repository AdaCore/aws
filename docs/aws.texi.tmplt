@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

@noindent
@code{AWS} stand for @i{Ada Web Server}. It is an Ada implementation of the
@code{HTTP/1.1} protocol as defined in the RFC 2616 from June 1999.

@sp 1
@noindent
The goal is not to build a full Web server but more to make it possible
to use a Web browser (like Internet Explorer, or Netscape Navigator) to
control an Ada application. As we'll see later it is also possible to
have two Ada programs exchange informations via the @code{HTTP} protocol. This
is possible as @code{AWS} also implement the client side of the HTTP protocol.

@sp 1
@noindent
Moreover with this library it is possible to have more than one server
in a single application. It is then possible to export different kind
of services by using different @code{HTTP} ports, or to have different ports
for different services priority. Client which must be served with a
very high priority can be assigned a specific port for example.

@sp 1
@noindent
As designed, @code{AWS} big difference with a standard @code{CGI} server
is that there is only one executable. A @code{CGI} server has one
executable for each request or so, this becomes a pain to build and
to distribute when the project gets bigger. We will also see that it is
easier with @code{AWS} to deal with session data.

@sp 1
@noindent
@code{AWS} support also @code{HTTPS} (secure @code{HTTP}) using
@code{SSL}. This is based on @code{OpenSSL} a very good and Open Source SSL
implementation.

@sp 1
@noindent
Major supported features are:

@itemize @bullet

@item HTTP implementation

@item HTTPS (Secure HTTP) implementation based on SSLv3

@item Template Web pages (separate the code and the design)

@item Web Services - SOAP based

@item WSDL support (generate stub/skeleton from WSDL documents)

@item Basic and Digest authentication

@item Transparent session handling

@item File upload

@item Server push

@item SMTP / POP (client API)

@item LDAP (client API)

@item Embedded resources (full self dependant Web server)

@item Complete client API, including HTTPS

@item Web server activity log

@node Requirements
@section Requirements

@noindent
@code{AWS} has been mainly developed with @code{GNAT} on Windows NT
and built and tested many times on @code{GNU/Linux}, it should be fairly
portable across platforms. To build @code{AWS} you need:

@itemize @bullet

@item GNU/Ada (GNAT compiler) ;
@cindex GNAT
@cindex GNU/Ada

@code{AWS} uses some @code{GNAT} specific packages and we have no plan
to support another compiler at this point. It is too much work for us
to check if @code{AWS} compiles to other compilers anyway. To build
this version you need at least @code{GNAT 3.15}. On Windows you must also
install @code{GNATWin} (Windows specific package).

@item a socket binding (@b{optional}) ;
@cindex socket binding

@code{GNAT.Sockets} is the default socket implementation used. It is possible
to use @code{AdaSockets} (@code{AdaSockets} was used in AWS v 1.2) and
in this case you must install the @code{AdaSockets} package.

On Windows you must use the one distributed at @*
@url{http://perso.wanadoo.fr/pascal.obry/contrib.html} which is a
Win32 port (done by Dmitriy Anisimkov) of the ENST version.

On UNIX you must use the socket binding from ENST @*
@url{http://www.rfc1149.net/devel/adasockets}.

@item a POSIX binding - Interface to the underlying OS services (@b{optional}) ;
@cindex POSIX

On Windows you can use the one distributed at: 
@url{http://perso.wanadoo.fr/pascal.obry}. On UNIX look for the 
Florist package at @url{http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~baker/florist.html}.

@item OpenSSL (@b{optional}) ;
@cindex OpenSSL

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the @i{Secure Sockets Layer}
(SSL v2 and v3) and much more. You'll find libraries for Win32 into this
distribution. For other platforms just download the OpenSSL source
distribution from @url{http://www.openssl.org} and build it.

@item OpenLDAP (@b{optional}) ;
@cindex OpenLDAP

OpenLDAP is an Open Source toolkit implementing the 
@i{Lightweight Directory Access Protocol}.
If you want to use the @code{AWS/LDAP} API
on UNIX based systems, you need to install properly the @code{OpenLDAP}
package. On Windows you don't need to install it as the
@file{libldap.a} library will be built by @code{AWS} and will use the
standard Windows @code{LDAP DLL} @file{wldap32.dll}.

You can download OpenLDAP from @url{http://www.openldap.org}.

@end itemize

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node AWS.OS_Lib
@section AWS.OS_Lib
@cindex AWS.OS_Lib

@noindent
The @code{AWS.OS_Lib} has 3 implementations. One using @code{POSIX}, one using
@code{GNAT.OS_Lib} and one using direct @code{Win32} calls. This last
one is not anymore supported in this version. Contribution is welcome
of course.

@table @b

@item GNAT.OS_Lib implementation

Version using @code{GNAT.OS_Lib} is GNAT dependent and will run on whatever
OS GNAT has be ported to. This is the @b{default implementation} used.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ make gnat_oslib
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item POSIX implementation

Version with @code{POSIX} is compiler and OS independent (well if you
have a @code{POSIX} implementation for your OS). Check out @code{Florist}
which is available on many @code{UNIX} and the version for Win32 is
available on @url{http://perso.wanadoo.fr/pascal.obry/contrib.html}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ make posix_oslib
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item Win32 implementation (not anymore supported)

Version for Win32 should be usable by any Ada compiler for Windows 
95/98/NT/2000/XP.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ make win32_oslib
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@end table

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node AWS.Net.Std
@section AWS.Net.Std
@cindex AWS.Net.Std

@noindent
This package is the standard (non-SSL) socket implementation. It exists
different implementation of this package:

@table @b

@item GNAT implementation

Version based on @code{GNAT.Sockets}, is @code{GNAT} dependent and will
run on whatever OS @code{GNAT} has be ported to. This is the 
@b{default implementation} used. To select this implementation just do:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ make gnatsockets
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item AdaSockets implementation

Version using @code{AdaSockets} packages. This was the default implementation
used up to AWS 1.2. To select this implementation just do:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ make adasockets
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@end table

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Building
@section Building
@cindex Building

@noindent
When you have built and configured all libraries you must either set
@var{ADA_INCLUDE_PATH} and @var{ADA_OBJECTS_PATH} (for @code{GNAT}) to
point to the right directories or update the @var{ADASOCKETS},
@var{XMLADA} and @var{INSTALL} variables in the top
@file{makefile.conf}. You should have a look at file @file{INSTALL}
for installation instructions.

@noindent
At this point you can build @code{AWS} with:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ make build
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Note that by default @code{AWS} demos will be built without @code{SSL}
support except on Windows. If you want to build the demos with
@code{SSL} on UNIX (in this case you must have @file{libssl.a} and
@file{libcrypto.a} available on your platform), open
@file{makefile.conf} and set the @var{MODE} variable to ssl. Then
rebuild with:
@cindex libssl.a
@cindex libcrypto.a

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ make build
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
What is important to understand is that @code{AWS SSL} support is
selected at @b{link time} and not at configure time.

@noindent
It is is possible to build @code{AWS} in debug mode by setting
@var{DEBUG} make's variable in @file{makefile.conf}, or just:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ make build DEBUG=1
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Others make's targets are:

@table @code

@item build_lib

Build AWS library only.

@item build_tools

Build AWS tools only.

@item build_demos

Build AWS demos only.

@end table

@noindent
For example, if you use @code{GNAT} and want to use the @code{GNAT.Sockets}
implementation, you can build and install AWS with (you do not need to
edit the makefile.conf):

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ make build
$ make install INSTALL=/opt
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Demos
@section Demos

@noindent
During the build, the @code{AWS} library and demos will be compiled. The
demos are a good way to learn how to use @code{AWS}. Yet to learn all
features in @code{AWS} you'll need to read the documentation.

@noindent
Here are a short description of the demos:

@table @file

@item agent

A program using the AWS client interface. This simple tool can be used
to retrieve Web page content. It supports passing through a proxy with
authentication and basic authentication on the Web site.

@item auth

A simple program to test the Web Basic and Digest authentication feature.

@item com_1
@item com_2

Two simples program that uses the AWS communication service.

@item dispatch

A simple demo using the dispatcher facility. @pxref{URI dispatcher}.

@item hello_world

The famous Hello World program. This is a server that will always
return a Web page saying ``Hello World!''.

@item main
@item hotplug

A simple test for the hotplug feature.

@item res_demo

A demo using the resource feature. This Web Server embedded a @code{PNG}
image and an @code{HTML} page. The executable is self contained.

@item runme

A complete example that test many @code{AWS} features. If this test runs fine
on your platform, @code{AWS} is certainly ok.

@item split

A demo for the transient pages and page splitter AWS's feature. Here a
very big table is split on multiple pages. A set of links can be used
to navigate to the next or previous page or to access directly to a
given page.

@item test_jabber

A simple Jabber command line client to check the presence of a JID
(Jabber ID). This uses the Jabber API, @pxref{AWS.Jabber}.

@item test_ldap

A simple LDAP demo which access a public LDAP server and display some
information.

@item text_input

A simple demo which handle textarea and display the content.

@item vh_demo

Two servers on the same machine... virtual hosting demo.
@pxref{Virtual host dispatcher}.

@item web_mail

A simple Web Mail implementation that works on a POP mailbox.

@item ws

A static Web page server and push enabled server.

@item wps

A very simple static Web page server based on @code{AWS.Services.Page_Server}. 
@pxref{Static Page server}.

@item zdemo

A simple demo of the Gzip content encoding feature.

@end table

@noindent
If @code{XMLAda} is installed it is possible to build the @code{SOAP} binding
and the @code{SOAP} demos, for this just type:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ make build_soap
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
There is four demos:

@table @file

@item soap_client
@item soap_server

A simple client/server program to test the @code{SOAP} protocol.

@item soap_svs

A server that implements the seven @code{SOAP} procedures for the validation
suite on @url{http://validator.soapware.org/}. This demo can be used
to validate @code{AWS/SOAP} on your platform.

@item soap_cvs

The client @code{SOAP} program that test all seven @code{SOAP}
procedure of the above server.

@end table

@noindent
In each case you'll certainly have to edit the makefile to correctly set
the include path for the libraries @code{POSIX}, @code{OpenSSL}, 
@code{Socket} and @code{XMLAda}. For more information, look at the makefiles.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Installing
@section Installing
@cindex Installing

@noindent
When the build is done you must install @code{AWS} at a specific
location. The target directory is defined with the @var{INSTALL}
@file{makefile.conf} variable. The default value is your home directory. To
install:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ make install
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
To install @code{AWS} into another directory you can either edit
@file{makefile.conf} and set @var{INSTALL} to the directory you like
to install @code{AWS} or just force the make @code{INSTALL} variable:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ make install INSTALL=/opt
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Now you are ready to use @code{AWS} !

@node Using environment variables
@subsection Using environment variables

@noindent
After installing @code{AWS} you must set the build environment to
point the compiler to the right libraries. First let's say that
@code{AWS} has been installed in @file{awsroot} directory.

@noindent
This can be done automatically for the @code{GNAT} compiler by using
the @file{<awsroot>/set-aws.sh} on UNIX or @file{<awsroot>\set-aws.cmd}
on Windows.

If you pefer setting the environment yourself here is how to do with
@code{GNAT}.

@table @b

@item spec files

The spec files are installed in @file{<awsroot>/include}. Add this
path into @var{ADA_INCLUDE_PATH} or put it on the command line
@code{-aI<awsroot>/include}.

@item components

@code{AWS} uses some components they are installed in
@file{<awsroot>/components}. Add this path into ADA_INCLUDE_PATH or
put it on the command line @code{-I<awsroot>/components}.

@item libraries

The GNAT library files (@file{.ali}) and the @code{AWS} libraries
(@file{libaws.a}) are installed into @file{<awsroot>/lib}. Add this
path into @var{ADA_OBJECTS_PATH} or put it on the command line
@code{-aO<awsroot>/lib}. Furthermore for @code{gnatlink} to find the
libraries you must add the following library path option on the
@code{gnatmake} command line @code{-largs -L<awsroot>/lib -laws}.

Note that to build SSL applications you need to add @code{-lssl -lcrypto} on
gnatmake's @code{-largs} section.

@item external libraries

You must do the same thing for all external libraries that you will
be using. For example you'll have to point @code{GNAT} to the
@code{AdaSockets} libraries and pass @code{-ladasockets} on the gnatmake's
@code{-largs} section. The same apply if you have built @code{AWS} with
@code{POSIX} or with @code{SSL} support.

@end table

@node Using GNAT Project Files
@subsection Using GNAT Project Files

@noindent
The best solution is to use the installed GNAT Project File
@file{aws.gpr}. This is supported only for @code{GNAT 5.01} or
above. You must have installed @code{XMLAda} with project file
support too.

If this is the case just set the @var{ADA_PROJECT_PATH} variable to
point to the @code{AWS} and @code{XMLAda} install directories. From
there you just have to with the @code{AWS} project file in your GNAT
Project file, nothing else to set.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{with} "aws";

@b{project} Simple @b{is}

   @b{for} Main @b{use} ("prog.adb");

   @b{for} Source_Dirs @b{use} (".");

   @b{for} Object_Dir @b{use} ".";

@b{end} Simple;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
If your application must support SSL, you have to link against the
@file{-lcrypto} and @file{-lssl} libraries. Add a package
@code{Linker} in your project file, something like:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{package} Linker @b{is}

   @b{for} Default_Switches ("Ada") @b{use} ("-lcrypto", "-lssl");

@b{end} Linker;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
See the @i{GNAT User's Guide} for more information about GNAT Project Files.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Basic notions
@section Basic notions

@noindent
@code{AWS} is not a Web Server like @i{IIS} or @i{Apache}, it is a component
to embedded HTTP protocol in an application. It means that it is possible
to build an application which can also answer to a standard browser like
@i{Internet Explorer} or @i{Netscape Navigator}. Since @code{AWS} provides
support client and server HTTP protocol, applications can communicate
through the HTTP channel. This give a way to build distributed
applications, @xref{AWS.Client}.

@noindent
An application using @code{AWS} can open many @code{HTTP} channels. Each
channel will use a specific port. For example, it is possible to
embedded many @code{HTTP} and/or many @code{HTTPS} channels in the
same application.

@subsection Building an AWS server

@noindent
To build a server you must:

@enumerate

@item declare the HTTP Web Server
@cindex HTTP declaration

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
WS  : AWS.Server.HTTP;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item Start the server
@cindex starting server

@noindent
You need to start the server before using it. This is done by calling
@code{AWS.Server.Start} (@xref{AWS.Server}.)

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{procedure} Start
  (Web_Server                : @b{in out} HTTP;
   Name                      : @b{in}     String;
   Callback                  : @b{in}     Response.Callback;
   Max_Connection            : @b{in}     Positive     := Def_Max_Connect;
   Admin_URI                 : @b{in}     String       := Def_Admin_URI;
   Port                      : @b{in}     Positive     := Def_Port;
   Security                  : @b{in}     Boolean      := False;
   Session                   : @b{in}     Boolean      := False;
   Case_Sensitive_Parameters : @b{in}     Boolean      := True;
   Upload_Directory          : @b{in}     String       := Def_Upload_Dir);
@i{--  Start the Web server. It initialize the Max_Connection connections}
@i{--  lines. Name is just a string used to identify the server. This is used}
@i{--  for example in the administrative page. Admin_URI must be set to enable}
@i{--  the administrative status page. Callback is the procedure to call for}
@i{--  each resource requested. Port is the Web server port. If Security is}
@i{--  set to True the server will use an HTTPS/SSL connection. If Session is}
@i{--  set to True the server will be able to get a status for each client}
@i{--  connected. A session ID is used for that, on the client side it is a}
@i{--  cookie. Case_Sensitive_Parameters if set to False it means that the CGI}
@i{--  parameters name will be handled without case sensitivity. Upload}
@i{--  directory point to a directory where uploaded files will be stored.}
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
@code{Start} takes many parameters:

@table @b

@item Web_Server
@cindex Web_Server

this is the Web server to start.

@item Name

This is a string to identify the server. This name will be used for
example in the administrative status page.

@item Callback
@cindex Callback

This is the procedure to call for each requested resources. In this
procedure you must handle all the possible URI that you want to support.
(see below).

@item Max_Connection
@cindex Max_Connection

This is the maximum number of simultaneous connections. It means that
Max_Connection client's browsers can gets answer at the same
time. This parameter must be changed to match your needs. A medium Web
server will certainly need something like 20 or 30 simultaneous
connections.

@item Admin_URI
@cindex Admin_URI

This is a special URI recognized internally by the server. If this URI
is requested the server will return the administrative page. This page
is built using a specific template page (default is
@file{@_STATUS_PAGE_@}) @pxref{Status page}.

The administrative page returns many information about the server. It is
possible to configure the server via two configuration files
@xref{Configuration options}.

@item Port
@cindex Port

This is the port to use for the Web server. You can use any free port on
your computer. Note that on some OS specific range could be reserved
or needs specials privileges (port 80 on Linux for example).

@item Security
@cindex Security

If Security is set to True the server will use an HTTPS/SSL
connection. This part uses the @code{OpenSSL} library.

@item Session
@cindex Session

If Session is set to true the server will keep a session ID for each
client. The client will be able to save and get variables associated
with this session ID.

@item Case_Sensitive_Parameters
@cindex Case_Sensitive_Parameters

If set to True the CGI name parameters will be handled without using the
case.

@end table

@noindent
Note that there is other @code{Start} routines which support other features.
For example there is a @code{Start} routine which use a dispatcher routine
instead of the simple callback procedure. @pxref{AWS.Server}. And
there is also the version using a @code{Config.Object} which is the most
generic one.

@item provides a callback procedure

@noindent
The callback procedure has the following prototype:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} Service (Request : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data) @b{return} AWS.Response.Data;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
This procedure receive the request status. It is possible to retrieve
information about the request through the @code{AWS.Status} API 
(@xref{AWS.Status}.).

@noindent
For example, to know what URI has been asked:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
URI : @b{constant} String := AWS.Status.URI (Request);

@b{if} URI = "/whatever" @b{then}
   ...
@b{end if};
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Then this function should return an answer using one of the constructors
in @code{AWS.Response} (@xref{AWS.Response}.). For example, to return an
HTML message:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
AWS.Response.Build (Content_Type => "text/html",
                    Message_Body => "<p>just a demo");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
It is also possible to return a file. For example, here is the way to
return a PNG image:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
AWS.Response.File (Content_Type => "image/png",
                   Filename     => "adains.png");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@end enumerate

@noindent
Note that the main procedure should exit only when the server is terminated.
For this you can use the @code{AWS.Server.Wait} service.

@noindent
A better solution is to use a template engine like Templates_Parser to
build the HTML Web Server answer. Templates_Parser module is
distributed with this version of AWS. For the latest version see
@url{http://perso.wanadoo.fr/pascal.obry/contrib.html}.

@node Callback procedure
@subsection Callback procedure
@cindex Callback
@cindex Callback procedure

@noindent
The callback procedure is the user's code that will be called by the AWS
component to get the right answer for the requested resource. In fact
AWS just open the HTTP message, parsing the HTTP header and it builds
an object of type @code{AWS.Status.Data}. At this point it calls the
user's callback procedure, passing the object. The callback procedure
must returns the right response for the requested resources. Now AWS
will just build up the HTTP response message and send it back to
user's browser.

@noindent
@b{But what is the resource ?}
@cindex resources

@noindent
Indeed in a standard Web development a resource is either a static
object - an HTML page, an @code{XML} or @code{XSL} document - or a @code{CGI}
script. With @code{AWS} a resource is @i{just a string} to identify
the resource, it does not represent the name of a static object or
@code{CGI} script.

@noindent
So this string is just an internal representation for the
resource. The callback procedure must be implemented to handle each
internal resource and return the right response.

@noindent
Let's have a small example. For example we want to build a Web server
that will answer ``Hello World'' if we ask for the internal resource 
@b{/hello}, and must answer ``Hum...'' otherwise.

@cindex Hello world
@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{with} AWS.Response;
@b{with} AWS.Server;
@b{with} AWS.Status;

@b{procedure} Hello_World @b{is}

   WS : AWS.Server.HTTP;

   @b{function} HW_CB (Request : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data)
     @b{return} AWS.Response.Data 
   @b{is}
      URI : @b{constant} String := Status.URI (Request);
   @b{begin}
      @b{if} URI = "/hello" @b{then}
         @b{return} AWS.Response.Build ("text/html", "<p>Hello world !");
      @b{else}
         @b{return} AWS.Response.Build ("text/html", "<p>Hum...");
      @b{end if};
   @b{end} HW_CB;

@b{begin}
   AWS.Server.Start
      (WS, "Hello World", Callback => HW_CB'Unrestricted_Access);
   @b{delay} 30.0;
@b{end} Hello_World;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Now of course the resource internal name can represent a file on
disk. It is not mandatory but it is possible. For example it is
perfectly possible to build with AWS a simple page server.

@cindex Page server
@cindex Simple server
@noindent
As an example, let's build a simple page server. This server will
returns files in the current directory. Resources internal name
represent an HTML page or a GIF or PNG image for example. This
server will return a 404 message (Web Page Not Found) if the file does
not exist. Here is the callback procedure that implement such simple
page server:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} Get (Request : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data) @b{return} AWS.Response.Data @b{is}
   URI      : @b{constant} String := AWS.Status.URI (Request);
   Filename : @b{constant} String := URI (2 .. URI'Last);
@b{begin}
   @b{if} OS_Lib.Is_Regular_File (Filename) @b{then}
      @b{return} AWS.Response.File
        (Content_Type => AWS.MIME.Content_Type (Filename),
         Filename     => Filename);

   @b{else}
      return AWS.Response.Acknowledge
        (Messages.S404,
         "<p>Page '" & URI & "' Not found.");
   @b{end if};
@b{end} Get;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@node Form parameters
@subsection Form parameters
@cindex Form parameters
@cindex Parameters

@noindent
Form parameters are stored into a table of key/value pair. The key is the form
input tag name and the value is the content of the input field as filled by
the user.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Enter your name 

<FORM METHOD=GET ACTION=/get-form>"
<INPUT TYPE=TEXT NAME=name VALUE="<default>" size=15>
<INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT NAME=go VALUE="Ok">
</FORM>
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Note that as explained above @pxref{Callback procedure}, the resource
described in @code{ACTION} is just an internal string representation
for the resource.

@noindent
In this example there is two form parameters:

@table @b
@item name
The value is the content of this text field as filled by the client.

@item go
The value is "Ok".
@end table

@noindent
There is many functions (in @code{AWS.Parameters}) to retrieve the tag name
or value and the number of parameters. Here are some examples:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} Service (Request : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data) 
  @b{return} AWS.Response.Data
@b{is}
   P : @b{constant} AWS.Parameters.List := AWS.Status.Parameters (Request);
   ...
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample


@table @code
@item AWS.Parameters.Get (P, "name")
@cindex Parameters Get
Returns the value for parameter named @b{name}

@item AWS.Parameters.Get_Name (P, 1)
@cindex Parameters Get_Name
Returns the string "name".

@item AWS.Parameters.Get (P, 1)
Returns the value for parameter named @b{name}

@item AWS.Parameters.Get (P, "go")
Returns the string "Ok".

@item AWS.Parameters.Get_Name (P, 2)
Returns the string "go".

@item AWS.Parameters.Get (P, 2)
Returns the string "Ok".
@end table

@noindent
@code{Request} is the @code{AWS} current connection status passed to the
callback procedure. And @code{P} is the parameters list retrieved from the
connection status data. For a discussion about the callback procedure
@xref{Building an AWS server}.

@node Distribution of an AWS server
@subsection Distribution of an AWS server
@cindex Distributing

@noindent
The directory containing the server program must contain the following
files if you plan to use a status page @xref{Status page}.

@table @file
@item @_STATUS_PAGE_@

The template HTML file for the @code{AWS} status page.

@item @_LOGO_IMAGE_@

The @code{AWS} logo displayed on the status page.

@item @_UP_IMAGE_@

The @code{AWS} hotplug table up arrow.

@item @_DOWN_IMAGE_@

Note that these filenames are the current @code{AWS} default. But it is
possible to change those defaults using the configuration files
@pxref{Configuration options}.

@node Building answers
@section Building answers

@noindent
We have already seen, in simple examples, how to build basic answers using
@code{AWS.Response} API. In this section we present all ways to build
answers from basic support to the more advanced support like the
compressed memory stream response.

@end menu

@node Redirection
@subsection Redirection

@noindent
A redirection is a way to redirect the client's browser to another
URL. Client's won't notice that a redirection has occurs. As soon as
the browser has received the response from the server it will retrieve
the page as pointed by the redirection.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
   @b{return} Response.URL (Location => "/use-this-one");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@node New location for a page
@subsection New location for a page

@noindent
User will receive a Web page saying that this page has moved and
eventually pointing to the new location.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
   @b{return} Response.Moved
     (Location => "/use-this-one";
      Message  => "This page has moved, please update your reference");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@node Authentication required
@subsection Authentication required

@noindent
For protected pages you need to ask user to enter a password.
@pxref{Authentication}.

@node Sending back an error message
@subsection Sending back an error message

@noindent
@code{Acknowledge} can be used to send back error messages. There is
many kind of status code, see @code{Message.Status_Code}
definition. Together with the status code it is possible to pass
textual error message in @code{Message_Body} parameter.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
   @b{return} Response.Acknowledge
     (Status_Code  => Messages.S503,
      Message_Body => "Can't connect to the database, please retry later.",
      Content_Type => MIME.Text_Plain);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@node Response from a string
@subsection Response from a string

@noindent
This is the simplest way to build a response object. There is two
constructors in @code{AWS.Response}, one based on a standard string
and one for Unbounded_String.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
   @b{return} Response.Build (MIME.Text_HTML, "My answer");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
The Build routine takes also a status code parameter to handle
errors. By default this code is @code{Messages.S200} which is the
standard HTTP status (no error encountered). The other parameter can
be used to control caches. @pxref{AWS.Response}.

@node Response from a Stream_Element_Array
@subsection Response from a Stream_Element_Array

@noindent
This is exactly as above but the Build routine takes a
@code{Stream_Element_Array} instead of a string.

@node Response from a file
@subsection Response from a file

@noindent
To build a @code{File} response there is a single constructor named
@code{File}. This routine is very similar to the one above except that
we specify a filename as the response.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
   @b{return} Response.File (MIME.Text_HTML, "index.html");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Again there parameters to control the status code and cache. No check
on the filename is done at this point, so if @file{index.html} does
not exit no exception is raised. The server is responsible to check
for the file and to properly send back the 404 message if necessary.

@noindent
Note that this routine takes an optional parameter named @code{Once}
that is to be used for temporary files created on the server side for
the client. With @code{Once} set to @code{True} the file will be
deleted by the server after sending it.

@node Response from a stream
@subsection Response from a stream

@noindent
Sometimes it is not possible (or convenient) to build the response in
memory as a string object for example. Streams can be used to
workaround this. The constructor for such response is again very
similar to the ones above except that instead of the data we pass an
handle to a @code{Resources.Streams.Stream_Type} object.

@noindent
The first step is to build the stream object. This is done by deriving
a new type from @code{Resources.Streams.Stream_Type} and implementing
three abstract procedures.

@table @code
@item Read

Must return the next chunk of data from the stream. Note that
initialization if needed are to be done there during the first call to
read.

@item End_Of_File

Must return True when there is no more data on the stream.

@item Close

Must close the stream and for example release all memory used by the
implementation.
@end table

@noindent
The second step is to build the response object:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
   @b{type} SQL_Stream @b{is new} Resources.Streams.Stream_Type;

   Stream_Object : SQL_Stream;

   @b{procedure} Read (...) @b{is} ...
   @b{function} End_Of_File (...) @b{return} Boolean @b{is} ...
   @b{procedure} Close (...) @b{is}

   ...

   @b{return} Response.Stream (MIME.Text_HTML, Stream_Object);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Note that in some cases it is needed to create a file containing the
data for the client (for example a tar.gz or a zip archive). But there
is no way to properly remove this file from the file system as we
really don't know when the upload is terminated when using the
@code{AWS.Response.File} constructor. To solve this problem it is
possible to use a stream as the procedure @code{Close} is called by
the server when all data have been read. In this procedure it is
trivial to do the necessary clean-up.

@node Response from a memory stream
@subsection Response from a memory stream

@noindent
This is an implementation of the standard stream support described
above. In this case the stream is in memory and built by adding data
to it.

@noindent
To create a memory stream just declare an object of type
@code{AWS.Resources.Streams.Memory.Stream_Type}. When created, this
memory stream is empty, using the @code{Streams.Memory.Append}
routines it is possible to add chunk of data to it. It is of course
possible to call @code{Append} as many times as needed. When done just
return this object to the server.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
   Data : AWS.Resources.Streams.Memory.Stream_Type;

   Append (Data, Translator.To_Stream_Element_Array ("First chunk"));
   Append (Data, Translator.To_Stream_Element_Array ("Second chunk..."));

   ...

   @b{return} Response.Stream (MIME.Text_HTML, Data);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Note that you do not have to take care of releasing the allocated
memory, the default @code{Close} routine will do just that.

@node Response from a compressed memory stream
@subsection Response from a compressed memory stream

@noindent
This is a slight variant of the standard memory stream described
above. In this case the stream object must be declared as a
@code{AWS.Resources.Streams.Memory.ZLib.Stream_Type}.

@noindent
The ZLib stream object must be initialized to enable the
compression and select the right parameters. This is done using the
@code{AWS.Resources.Streams.Memory.ZLib.Deflate_Initialize} routine which
takes many parameters to select the right options for the compression
algorithm, all of them have good default values. When initialized the
compressed stream object is used exactly as a standard stream.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
   Data : AWS.Resources.Streams.Memory.ZLib.Stream_Type;

   Deflate_Initialize (Data);

   Append (Data, Translator.To_Stream_Element_Array ("First chunk"));
   Append (Data, Translator.To_Stream_Element_Array ("Second chunk..."));

   ...

   @b{return} Response.Stream (MIME.Text_HTML, Data);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Note that there is the reverse implementation to decompress a
stream. @pxref{AWS.Resources.Streams.Memory.ZLib}. It's usage
is identical.

@node Split page
@subsection Split page

@code{AWS} has a specific high level service to split a large response
into a set of pages. For more information @pxref{Split pages}.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Configuration options
@section Configuration options
@cindex Configuration options

@noindent
To configure an @code{AWS} server it is possible to use a
configuration object. This object can be set using the @code{AWS.Config.Set}
API or initialized using a configuration file.

@noindent
Configuration files are a way to configure the server without
recompiling it. Each application can be configured using two
configurations files:

@table @file

@item aws.ini
@cindex aws.ini
@cindex ini file

This file is parsed first and corresponds to the configuration for all
AWS server runs in the same directory.

@item <program_name>.ini
@cindex program_name.ini

This file is parsed after @file{aws.ini}. It is possible with this
initialization file to have specific settings for some servers.

@end table

@noindent
Furthermore, it is possible to read a specific configuration file
using the @code{AWS.Config.Ini.Read} routine. @pxref{AWS.Config.Ini}.

@noindent
Current supported options are:

@node Session handling
@section Session handling
@cindex Session

@noindent
@code{AWS} provides a way to keep session data while users are
browsing. There is no need to mess with the Cookies, @code{AWS} will do
that for you. The idea is simple. A session ID will be transparently
created and then you'll be able to insert and retrieve session data
using a standard Ada API (@xref{AWS.Session}.). Session data
are key/value pair each of them being strings. How to deal with that ?

@itemize @bullet

@item First you declare and start an HTTP channel with session enabled:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
WS : AWS.Server.HTTP;

Server.Start (WS,
              Port     => 1234,
              Callback => Service'Access,
              Session  => True);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Here we have built an HTTP channel with a maximum of 3 simultaneous
connections using the port 1234. A session ID will be created and sent
inside a cookie to the client's browser at the first request. This
session ID will be sent back to the server each time the client will ask
for a resource to the server.

@item Next, in the Service callback procedure that you have provided you
must retrieve the Session ID. As we have seen, the callback procedure
has the following prototype:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} Service (Request : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data) @b{return} AWS.Response.Data;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
The Session ID is kept in the Request object and can be retrieved using:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Session_ID  : @b{constant} AWS.Session.ID := AWS.Status.Session (Request);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item From there it is quite easy to get or set some session data using
the provided API. For example:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{declare}
   C : Integer;
@b{begin}
   C := AWS.Session.Get (Session_ID, "counter");
   C := C + 1;
   AWS.Session.Set (Session_ID, "counter", C);
@b{end};
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
This example first get the value (as an Integer) for session data whose
key is "@code{counter}", increment this counter and then set it back to
the new value.

@end itemize

@noindent
It is also possible to save and restore all session data. It means that the
server can be shutdown and launched some time after and all client data are
restored as they were at shutdown time. Client will just see nothing. With this
feature it is possible to shutdown a server to update its look or because a
bug has been fixed for example. It is then possible to restart it
keeping the complete Web server context.

@node Authentication
@section Authentication
@cindex authentication
@cindex basic
@cindex digest

@noindent
@code{AWS} supports @b{Basic} and @b{Digest} authentication. The
authentication request can be sent at any time from the callback
procedure. For this the @code{AWS.Response.Authenticate} message must
be returned.

@noindent
The authentication process is as follow:

@enumerate

@item Send authentication request

@sp 1
From the callback routine return an authentication request when
needed.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} Service (Request : @b{in} Status.Data) @b{return} Response.Data @b{is}
   URI  : @b{constant} String := Status.URI (Request);
   User : @b{constant} String := Status.Authorization_Name (Request);
@b{begin}
   @i{--  URI starting with "/prot/" are protected}
   @b{if} URI (URI'First .. URI'First + 5) = "/prot/" 
     @b{and then} User = ""
   @b{then}
      @b{return} Response.Authenticate ("AWS", Response.Basic);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

The first parameter is the @b{Realm}, it is just a string that will be
displayed (on the authentication dialog box) by the browser to
indicate for which resource the authentication is needed.

@item Check authentication

@sp 1
When an authentication as been done the callback's request data
contain the user and password. Checks the values against an ACL for
each protected resources.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} Protected_Service 
  (Request : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data) 
   @b{return} AWS.Response.Data 
@b{is}
   User : @b{constant} String := Status.Authorization_Name (Request);
   Pwd  : @b{constant} String := Status.Authorization_Password (Request);
@b{begin}
   @b{if} User = "xyz" @b{and then} Pwd = "azerty" @b{then}
      @b{return} ...;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@end enumerate

@noindent
Note that the @b{Basic} authentication is not secure at all. The password
is sent unencoded by the browser to the server. If security is an
issue it is better to use the @b{Digest} authentication and/or an
@b{SSL} server.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node File upload
@section File upload
@cindex File upload
@cindex upload, server

@noindent
File upload is the way to send a file from the client to the server. To
enable file upload on the client side the Web page must contain a @b{FORM}
with an @b{INPUT} tag of type @b{FILE}. The @b{FORM} must also contain
the @b{enctype} attribute set to @i{multipart/form-data}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
<FORM enctype="multipart/form-data" ACTION=/whatever METHOD=POST>
File to process: <INPUT NAME=filename TYPE=FILE>
<INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT NAME=go VALUE="Send File">
</FORM>
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
On the server side, AWS will retrieve the file and put it into the
upload directory. AWS add a prefix to the file to ensure that the
filename will be uniq on the server side. The upload directory can be
changed using the configuration options. @xref{Configuration options}.

@noindent
AWS will also setup the form parameters as usual. In the above example
there is two parameters (@xref{Form parameters}.)

@table @b
@item filename
This variable contains two values, one with the client side name and
one with the server side name.

@table @i
@item First value : Parameters.Get (P, "filename")

The value is the full pathname of the file on the server. (i.e. the
upload directory catenated with the prefix and filename).

@item Second value : Parameters.Get (P, "filename", 2)

The value is the full pathname of the file on the client side.
@end table

@item go
The value is "Send File"

@node Communication
@section Communication
@cindex Communication
@cindex Sending message

@noindent
This API is used to do communication between programs using the HTTP
GET protocol. It is a very simple API not to be compared with @code{GLADE}
or @code{SOAP}. This communication facility is to be used for simple
request or when a light communication support is needed. For more
complex communications or to achieve inter-operability with other
modules it is certainly a good idea to have a look at the
@code{AWS/SOAP} support, @pxref{SOAP}.

@noindent
In a communication there is a Client and a Server. Here is what is to be
done on both sides to have programs talking together.

@menu
* Communication - client side::
* Communication - server side::
@end menu

@node Communication - client side
@subsection Communication - client side
@cindex Communication, Client

@noindent
On the client side it is quite simple. You just have to send a message
using @code{AWS.Communication.Client.Send_Message}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} Send_Message
  (Server     : @b{in} String;
   Port       : @b{in} Positive;

   Parameters : @b{in} Parameter_Set := Null_Parameter_Set)
   @b{return} Response.Data;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
The message is sent to the specified server using the given port. A
message is composed of a name which is a string and a set of
parameters. There is a parameter set constructor in
@code{AWS.Communication}. This function return a response as for any
callback procedure.

@node Communication - server side
@subsection Communication - server side
@cindex Communication, Server

@noindent
On the server side things are a bit more complex but not that
difficult. You must instantiate the @code{AWS.Communication.Server}
generic package by providing a callback procedure. This callback
procedure will must handle all kind of message that a client will send.

@noindent
During instantiation you must also pass a context for the communication
server. This context will be passed back to the callback procedure.

@smallexample

@cindex hotplug

@noindent
An @b{Hotplug module} is a module that can by dynamically binded to a
running server. It is a Web server and the development process is very
similar to what we have seen until now @xref{Building an AWS server}. 
The Hotplug module will register itself into a Web server by
sending a message using the communication API. The Hotplug module send
to the server a regular expression and an URL. The main server will
redirect all URL matching the regular expression to the Hotplug module.

@noindent
Note that the main server will redirect the URL to the first matching
regular expression.

@menu

* Hotplug module - creation::
@end menu

@node Hotplug module - server activation
@subsection Hotplug module - server activation

@noindent
The first step is to properly create the main server hotplug module
registration file. This file must list all hotplug modules that can
register into the main server. Each line have the following format:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
hotplug_module_name:password:server:port
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@table @b

@item hotplug_module_name

The name of the hotplug module. You can choose any name you want. This
name will be use during the registration process and to generate the
password.

@item password

The MD5 password, see below.

@item server

The name of the server where the redirection will be made. This is for
security reasons, main server will not permit to redirect requests to
any other server.

@item port

The port to use for the redirection on @code{server}.

@end table

@noindent
You must create a password for each hotplug modules. The generated
password depends on the hotplug module name. A tool named
@code{hotplug_password} is provided with @code{AWS} to generate such
password. Usage is simple:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ hotplug_password <hotplug_module_name> <password>
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Then, after starting the main server you must activate the Hotplug feature:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
AWS.Server.Hotplug.Activate (WS'Unchecked_Access, 2222, "hotplug_conf.ini");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
@file{hotplug_conf.ini} is the hotplug module registration file
described above.

@node Hotplug module - creation
@subsection Hotplug module - creation

@noindent
Here is how to create an Hotplug module:

@enumerate 1

@item First you create a standard Web server @xref{Building an AWS server}.
@sp 1

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
WS : AWS.Server.HTTP
  (3, 1235, False, Hotplug_CB.Hotplug'Access, False);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

Here we have a server listening to the port 1235. This server can be
used alone if needed as any Server developed with AWS.
@sp 1

@item Then you register the Hotplug module to the main server
@xref{AWS.Client.Hotplug}.
@sp 1

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Response := AWS.Client.Hotplug.Register
  (Name     => "Hotplug_Module_Demo",
   Password => "my_password",
   Server   => "http://dieppe:2222",
   Regexp   => ".*AWS.*",
   URL      => "http://omsk:1235/");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
The hotplug module @code{Hotplug_Module_Demo} must have been declared
on the main server, the password and redirection must have been
properly recorded too for security reasons 
@pxref{Hotplug module - server activation}.
This command register @code{Hotplug_Module_Demo} into the server running
on the machine @code{dieppe} and ask it to redirect all @code{URL}
containing @code{AWS} to the server running on machine @code{omsk} on
port @code{1235}.

@sp 1

@item When the Hotplug module is stopped, you must unregister it
@sp 1

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Response := AWS.Client.Hotplug.Unregister
  (Name     => "Hotplug_Module_Demo",
   Password => "my_password",
   Server   => "http://dieppe:2222",
   Regexp   => ".*AWS.*");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

Here we ask to unregister @code{Hotplug_Module_Demo} from server
@code{dieppe}. As for the registration process a proper password must
be specified @pxref{Hotplug module - server activation}.

@node Server Push
@section Server Push
@cindex Server Push
@cindex Push

@noindent
Server Push is a feature that let the Web Server send continuously
data to client's  Web Browser or client applications. The client does
not have to reload at periodic time (which is what is called client
pull) to have the data updated, each time the server send a piece of
data it gets displayed on the client.

@noindent
To build a push server you need to build an instance of the
@code{AWS.Server.Push} package. This package takes a set of formal
parameters. Here are the step-by-step instructions to build a Push
Server:

@enumerate

@sp 1
@item The data to be sent
@sp 1
First you must create a type that will contains the data to be sent to
client's browser except if it is a standard Ada type. See
@code{Client_Output_Type} formal parameter.

@sp 1
@item The data that will be streamed
@sp 1
This is the representation of the data that will be sent to client's
browser. This will be either a @code{String} for Web pages or
@code{Stream_Element_Array} for binary data like pictures. See
@code{Stream_Output_Type} formal parameter.

@sp 1
@item The context
@sp 1
It is often nice to be able to configure each client with different
parameters if needed. This can be achieved with the Context data type
that will be passed as parameter of the conversion function described
below. See @code{Client_Environment} formal parameter.

@sp 1
@item Provides a function to convert from the data type to be sent to
the data that will be streamed.
@sp 1
This is a function that will transform the data described on point 1
above to the form described on point 2 above. See
@code{To_Stream_Output} formal parameter.

@sp 1
@item Build the Push Server
@sp 1
To do so you just need to instantiate @code{AWS.Server.Push} with the
above declarations.

@sp 1
@item Registering new clients
@sp 1
In the standard @code{AWS} procedure callback it is possible to register a
client if requested. This is done by calling
@code{AWS.Server.Push.Register}. It is possible to unregister a
client using @code{AWS.Server.Push.Unregister}. Each client must be
identified with a unique client ID. After registering a new client
from the callback procedure you must return the
@code{AWS.Response.Socket_Taken} message. This is very important, it
tells the server to not close this socket.

@sp 1
@item Sending the data
@sp 1
At this point it is possible to send data to clients. To do so
two routines are available.
@sp 1

@table @code
@item AWS.Server.Push.Send_To
@cindex Send_To
To send a piece of data to a specific client identified by its client ID.

@item AWS.Server.Push.Send
@cindex Send
To send a piece of data to all clients registered on this server.

@end table

@end enumerate

@noindent
Very large Internet applications should use this feature carefully. A
push server keeps a socket reserved for each registered clients and
the number of available sockets per process is limited by the OS.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Working with Server sockets
@section Working with Server sockets
@cindex Working with Server sockets

@noindent
With @code{AWS} is is possible to take out a socket from the server and give
it back later. This feature must be used carefully but it gives a lot
of flexibility. As the socket is taken away, the connection line (or slot)
is released, @code{AWS} can then use it to handle other requests.

@noindent
This can be used to better support heavy loaded servers when some
requests need a long time to complete. Long time here means longer
than most of the other requests which should be mostly interractives
for a Web server. Of course in such a case a keep-alive connection is
kept open.

@noindent
The usage in such a case is to take out the socket and put it in a
waiting line. This releases the connection for the server. When the
data to prepare the answer is ready you give back the socket to the
server.

@itemize @bullet

@sp 1
@item Take a socket from the server
@sp 1

This first step is done form the callback function. A user instead of
replying immediatly decides to take away the socket from the
server. The first step is to record the connection socket socket by
calling @code{AWS.Status.Socket}. The second step is to tell the
server to not release this socket by returning @code{AWS.Response.Socket_Taken}
from the callback function. At this point the server will continue to
serve other clients.

@noindent
Note that this feature is used by the server push implementation 
@pxref{Server Push}.

@sp 1
@item Give back the socket to the server
@sp 1

Calling @code{AWS.Sever.Give_Back_Socket} will register the socket for
reuse. This socket will be placed into a spool, next time the server
will check for incoming requests it will be picked up.

@node Server Log
@section Server Log
@cindex logs
@cindex Log.Start

@cindex Log.Stop_Error
@cindex Log.Flush

@noindent
It is possible to have the server activity logged into the file
@file{<progname>-Y-M-D.log}. To activate the logging you must call the
@code{AWS.Server.Log.Start}, and it is possible to stop logging by calling
@code{AWS.Server.Log.Stop}. Note that @code{AWS.Server.Log.Start} have
a parameter named @code{Auto_Flush} to control output buffering. This
parameter is False by default. If set to True, the log file will be
automatically flushed after each data. If the server logging is not
buffered, i.e. Auto_Flush is False, the log can still be flushed by
calling the @code{AWS.Server.Log.Flush} routine. @xref{AWS.Log}, for
more information especially about the way rotating logs can be
setup. Using this feature it is possible to have automatic split of
the log file each day, each month or at every run. See @code{AWS.Log}
spec. This is very useful to avoid having very big log files.

@noindent
The log format is using the same format than the Apache Web server.

@smallexample
<client IP> - <auth name> - [<date and time>] "<request>" <status code> <size>

For example:

@cartouche
@group

@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
@code{AWS} also support error log files. If activated every internal error
detected by @code{AWS} will gets logged into this special file. See 
@code{AWS.Server.Log.Start_Error} and

@subsection Initialization
@cindex certificate

@noindent
A server is configured as using the HTTPS protocol at the time it is
started. The only thing to do is to set the Start's Security parameter
to True. This will start a server and activate the @code{SSL} layer by
default. A secure server must use a valid certificate, the default one
is @file{@_DEFAULT_CERTIFICATE_@}. This certificate has been
created by the openssl tool and is valid until year 2008. Yet, this
certificate has not been signed. To build a secure server user's can
rely on, you must have a valid certificate signed by one of the
@b{Certificate Authorities}.

@noindent
The certificate to be used must be specified before starting the
secure server with @code{AWS.Server.Set_Security}.

@node Unexpected exception handler
@section Unexpected exception handler
@cindex exception handler

@noindent
When @code{AWS} detects an internal problem, it calls a specific
handler. This handler can be used to log the error, send an alert
message or build the answer to be sent back to the client's browser.

@noindent
Here is the spec for this handler:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{type} Unexpected_Exception_Handler @b{is access}
  @b{procedure} (E           : @b{in}     Ada.Exceptions.Exception_Occurrence;
             Log         : @b{in out} AWS.Log.Object;
             Error       : @b{in}     Data;
             Answer      : @b{in out} Response.Data);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
The handler can be called in two modes:

@table @b

@item Non fatal error (Error.Fatal is False)

In this case @code{AWS} will continue working without problem. A
bug has been detected but it was not fatal to the thread (slot in
@code{AWS}'s terminology) handling. In this case it is possible to
send back an application level message to the client's browser. For
that you just have to fill the unexpected handler's @var{Answer} parameter
with the right response message. The @var{Error} parameter receive
information about the problem, @pxref{AWS.Exceptions}.

@item Fatal error (Error.Fatal is True)

In this case @code{AWS} will continue working but a thread (slot number
@var{Error.Slot} in @code{AWS}'s terminology) will be killed. It means
that @code{AWS} will have lost one the simultaneous connection
handler. The server will continue working unless it was the last slot handler
available. Note that a Fatal error means an @code{AWS} internal bug
and it should be reported if possible. In this mode there is no way to
send back an answer to the client's browser and @var{Error} value must
be ignored. 

@end table

@noindent
The default handler for unexpected exceptions send a message to
standard error for fatal errors. For non fatal errors it log a message
(if the error log is activated for the server) and send back a message
back to the client. The message is either a built-in one or, if present
in the server's directory, the content of the @file{500.tmplt} file.
This templates can used the following tags:

@table @b
@item AUTH_MODE
The authorization mode (Either NONE, BASIC or DIGEST).

@item EXCEPTION
Exception information with traceback if activated.

@item HTTP_VERSION
Either HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1

@item METHOD
The request method (Either GET, HEAD, POST or PUT)

@item PAYLOAD
The full @code{XML} payload for @code{SOAP} request.

@item PEERNAME
The IP address of the client

@item SOAP_ACTION
Either True or False. Set to True for a @code{SOAP} request.

@node Client side
@section Client side
@cindex Client protocol
@cindex client HTTP

@noindent
@code{AWS} is not only a server it also implement the HTTP and HTTPS
protocol from the client side. For example with @code{AWS} it is
possible to get a Web page content using the @code{AWS.Client} API,
@xref{AWS.Client}.

@noindent
It also support client @b{Keep-Alive} connections. It is then possible to
request many URI from the same server using the same connection
(i.e. the same sockets).

@noindent
@code{AWS} client API also support proxy, proxy authentication and Web server
authentication. Only basic (and not digest) authentication is
supported at this time.

@noindent
Let's say that you want to retrieve the @code{contrib.html} Web page from
Pascal Obry's homepage which is @url{http://perso.wanadoo.fr/pascal.obry}. The
code to do so is:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Data := Client.Get
  (URL => "http://perso.wanadoo.fr/pascal.obry/contrib.html");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
From there you can ask for the result's content type:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{if} Response.Content_Type (Data) = "text/html" @b{then}
   ...
@b{end if};
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Or using the MIME types defined in @code{AWS.MIME} unit:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{if} Response.Content_Type (Data) = MIME.Text_HTML @b{then}
   ...
@b{end if};
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
And display the content if it is some kind of text data:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Text_IO.Put_Line (Response.Message_Body (Data));
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
If the content is some kind of binary data (executable, PNG image, Zip
archive...), then it is possible to write the result to a file for
example. Look at the @code{agent} program in the @code{demos}
directory.

@noindent
If the Web page is protected and you must pass the request through an
authenticating proxy, the call will becomes:

@smallexample
@cartouche

@noindent
This service will help building a Web directory browser. It has a lot
of options to sort directory entries and is based on the templates
interface @pxref{AWS.Templates}. This means that you can use the
default directory template or provide your own.

@node Dispatchers
@section Dispatchers
@cindex Dispatchers

@noindent
In many AWS applications it is needed to check the URI to give the
right answer. This means that part of the application is a big
@b{if/elsif} procedure. Also, in standard callback it is not possible
to have user data. Both of these restrictions are addressed with the
Dispatchers facilities.

@noindent
Working with a dispatcher is quite easy:

@enumerate
@item Create a new dispatcher by inheriting from the service you want
to build.
@item Register a set of action based on rules (strings, regular
expressions depending on the service)
@end enumerate

@node Callback dispatcher
@subsection Callback dispatcher
@cindex Dispatchers callback
@cindex Callback, dispatcher

@noindent
This is a wrapper around the standard callback procedure. It is needed
to mix dispatcher based callback and access to procedure
callback. Note that it is not in the @code{AWS.Services.Dispatchers}
hierarchy but in @code{AWS.Dispatchers.Callback} because this is a
basic service needed for the server itself. It is referenced here for
documentation purpose but an AWS server can be built with using it.

@pxref{AWS.Dispatchers.Callback} for complete spec description.

@node Method dispatcher
@subsection Method dispatcher
@cindex Dispatchers method
@cindex method, dispatcher

@noindent
This is a dispatcher based on the request method. A different callback
procedure can be registered for the supported request methods: GET,
POST, PUT, HEAD.

@pxref{AWS.Services.Dispatchers.Method} for complete spec description.

@node URI dispatcher
@subsection URI dispatcher
@cindex Dispatchers URI
@cindex URI, dispatcher

@noindent
This is a dispatcher based on the request resource. A different callback
procedure can be registered for specific resources. The resource is
described either by its full name (string) or a regular expression.

@pxref{AWS.Services.Dispatchers.URI} for complete spec description.

@node Virtual host dispatcher
@subsection Virtual host dispatcher
@cindex Dispatchers virtual host
@cindex virtual host, dispatcher

@noindent
This is a dispatcher based on the host name. A different callback
procedure can be registered for specific host. This is also known as
virtual hosting.

@noindent
The same computer can be registered into the DNS with different
names. So all names point to the same machine. But in fact you want
each name to be seen as a different Web server. This is called virtual
hosting. This service will just do that, call different @b{callback}
procedures or redirect to some @b{machine/port} based on the host name
in the client's request.

@pxref{AWS.Services.Dispatchers.Virtual_Host} for complete spec description.

@node Transient pages dispatcher
@subsection Transient pages dispatcher
@cindex Dispatchers Transient pages
@cindex transient pages, dispatcher

@noindent
This is a dispatcher that calls a user's callback and if the resource
requested is not found (i.e. the user's callback returns status code
404) it checks if this resource is known as a transient
page. @pxref{Transient Pages}.

@node Timer dispatcher
@subsection Timer dispatcher
@cindex Dispatchers Timer
@cindex timer, dispatcher

@noindent
A timer dispatcher can be used to call different callback routines
depending on the current date and time. Such dispatcher is composed of
a set of @code{Period} activated. When the current date and time is
inside a @code{Period} the corresponding callback is called. A
@code{Period} can eventually be repeated. Here are the different kind
of @code{Period} supported by @code{AWS}:

@table @b

@item Once

A unique period in time. The boundaries are fully described using a
year, month, day, hour, minute and second.

@item Yearly

A period that repeats each year. The boundaries are described using a
month, day, hour, minute and second.

@item Monthly

A period that repeats each month. The boundaries are described using a
day, hour, minute and second.

@item Weekly

A period that repeats each week. The boundaries are described using a
day name, hour, minute and second.

@item Daily

A period that repeats each day. The boundaries are described using an
hour, minute and second.

@item Hourly

A period that repeats each hour. The boundaries are described using a
minute and second.

@item Minutely

A period that repeats each minute. The boundaries are described using
a second.

@noindent
Build this program and launch it, it will server HTML pages and images

@noindent
It is possible to activate the directory browsing facility of this
simple page server. This is not activated by default. This feature
is based on the directory browsing service @pxref{Directory browser}.

@noindent
Note that this service uses two template files:

@table @b
@item aws_directory.thtml

The template page used for directory browsing. See
@pxref{AWS.Services.Directory} for a full description of this template usage.

@item 404.thtml

The Web page returned if the requested page is not found. This is a
template with a single tag variable named PAGE. It will be replaced by
the ressource which was not found.

@i{Note that on Microsoft IE this page will be displayed only if the
total page size is bigger than 512 bytes or it includes at least one image.}

@node Transient Pages
@section Transient Pages
@cindex transient pages
@cindex pages, transient

@noindent
A transient page is a resource that has a certain life time on the
server. After this time the resource will be released and will not be
accessible anymore.

@noindent
Sometimes you want to reference, in a Web page, a resource that is built
in memory by the server. This resource can be requested by the client (by
clicking on the corresponding link) or not, in both cases the page must
be released after a certain amount of time to free the associated memory.

@noindent
This is exactly what the transient pages high level service do
automatically. Each transient page must be registered into the
service, a specific routine named @code{Get_URI} can be used to create
a unique @code{URI} on this server. @pxref{AWS.Services.Transient_Pages}.

@noindent
A transient pages dispatcher can be used to build a transient pages
aware server. @pxref{Transient pages dispatcher}.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Split pages
@section Split pages
@cindex split pages
@cindex pages, split

@noindent
It not not very convenient to send back a Web page with a large
table. In such a case it is better to split the table in chunks (20
lines or so) and to send only the first page. This page reference the
next pages and can also contains an index of the pages.

@noindent
The @code{AWS}'s split page feature can automatically do that for
you. Given template @code{Translate_Table} and the max line per page
it returns the first page and create a set of transient pages for all
other pages. A set of template tags are used to reference the previous
and next page and also to build the page index.
@pxref{AWS.Services.Split_Pages}.

@node Using SOAP
@chapter Using @code{SOAP}
@cindex SOAP
@cindex Simple Object Access Protocol

@noindent
@code{SOAP} can be used to implements Web Services. The @code{SOAP}
implementation uses @code{AWS HTTP} as the transport layer. @code{SOAP} is
platforms and languages independent, to ensure a good
inter-operability, @code{AWS/SOAP} implementations have been validated through
@url{http://validator.soapware.org/}, the version number listed on
this server corresponds to the AWS version string
(@code{AWS.Version}) catenated with the @code{SOAP} version string
(@code{SOAP.Version}).

@noindent
This @code{SOAP} implementation is certainly one with the higher level
of abstraction. No need to mess with a serializer, to know what is a
payload or be an @code{XML} expert. All the low level stuffs are
completely hidden as the @code{SOAP} type system has been binded as
much as possible to the Ada type system.

@noindent
@cindex WSDL
@cindex Web Service Definition Language
The @code{SOAP} type system has been relaxed to be compatible with
@code{WSDL} based @code{SOAP} implementation. In these implementations, types
are generally (as in the Microsoft implementation) not part of the
payload and should be taken from the @code{WSDL} (Web Services Description
Language). @code{AWS/SOAP} is not @code{WSDL} compliant at this stage, all
such types are binded into the Ada type system as strings. It is up to
the programer to convert such strings to the desired type.

@node SOAP Client
@section @code{SOAP} Client
@cindex SOAP Client

@noindent
The @code{SOAP} client interface is quite simple. Here are the step-by-step
instructions to call a @code{SOAP} Web Service:

@enumerate

@item Build the @code{SOAP} parameters
@sp 1

@noindent
As for the @code{SOAP} servers, the @code{SOAP} parameters are built using a
@code{SOAP.Parameters.List} object.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Params : @b{constant} Parameters.List 
  := +I (10, "v1") & I (32, "v2");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@sp 1
@item Build the @code{SOAP} Payload
@sp 1

@noindent
The Payload object is the procedure name and the associated parameters.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{declare}
   Payload : Message.Payload.Object;
@b{begin}
   Payload := Message.Payload.Build ("Add", Params);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@sp 1
@item Call the @code{SOAP} Web Service
@sp 1

@noindent
Here we send the above Payload to the Web Server which handles the Web
Service. Let's say that this server is named @code{myserver}, it is
listening on port @code{8082} and the @code{SOAPAction} is @code{soapdemo}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Resp : @b{constant} Message.Response.Object'Class :=
   SOAP.Client.Call ("http://myserver:8082/soapdemo", Payload);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@sp 1
@item Retrieve the result
@sp 1

@noindent
Let's say that the answer is sent back into the parameter named
"myres", to get it:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
My_Res : @b{constant} Integer := SOAP.Parameters.Get (Params, "myres");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@end enumerate

@noindent
In the above example we have called a Web Service whose spec could be
described in Ada as follow:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} Add (V1, V2 : @b{in} Integer) @b{return} Integer;
@i{--  Add V1 and V2 and returns the result. In SOAP the result is named "myres"}
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node SOAP Server
@section @code{SOAP} Server
@cindex SOAP Server
@cindex SOAPAction

@noindent
A @code{SOAP} server implementation must provides a callback procedure as for
standard Web server @pxref{Callback procedure}. This callback must
checks for the @code{SOAP} Action URI to handle both standard Web requests
and @code{SOAP} ones. The @code{SOAPAction} is sent with the HTTP headers and
can be retrieved using @code{AWS.Status.SOAPAction}.

@menu
* Step by step instructions::
* SOAP helpers::
@end menu

@node Step by step instructions
@subsection Step by step instructions

@noindent
Here are the step-by-step instructions to be followed in the @code{SOAP}
callback procedure:

@enumerate

@item Retrieve the @code{SOAP} Payload
@cindex Payload
@sp 1

@noindent
The @code{SOAP} Payload is the @code{XML} message, it contains the
procedure name to be called and the associated parameters.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} SOAP_CB (Request : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data) 
  @b{return} AWS.Response.Data 
@b{is}
   @b{use} SOAP.Types;
   @b{use} SOAP.Parameters;

   Payload : @b{constant} SOAP.Message.Payload.Object
     := SOAP.Message.XML.Load_Payload (AWS.Status.Payload (Request));
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
@code{AWS.Status.Payload} returns the @code{XML} Payload as sent by
the @code{SOAP} Client. This @code{XML} Payload is then parsed using
@code{SOAP.Message.XML.Load_Payload} which returns a
@code{SOAP.Message.Payload.Object} object.

@sp 1
@item Retrieve the @code{SOAP} Parameters
@sp 1

The @code{SOAP} procedure's parameters.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Params  : @b{constant} SOAP.Parameters.List
  := SOAP.Message.Parameters (Payload);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@code{SOAP.Parameters.List} is a structure which holds the @code{SOAP}
parameters. Each parameter can be retrieved using a
@code{SOAP.Parameters} API, @pxref{SOAP.Parameters}. For example to
get the parameter named @code{myStruc} which is a @code{SOAP} struct:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
My_Struct : @b{constant} SOAP_Record 
  := SOAP.Parameters.Get (Params, "myStruct");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

Another example, to get the parameter named @code{myInt} which is a
@code{SOAP} integer:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
My_Int : @b{constant} Integer := SOAP.Parameters.Get (Params, "myInt");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@sp 1
@item Implements the Web Service
@sp 1

@noindent
This is the real job, as for any procedure you can do whatever is
needed to compute the result.

@sp 1
@item Build the @code{SOAP} answer
@sp 1

@noindent
This is the procedure answer. A @code{SOAP} answer is built from the
@code{SOAP} Payload and by setting the returned parameters.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{declare}
   Resp        : SOAP.Message.Response.Object;
   Resp_Params : SOAP.Parameters.List;
@b{begin}
   Resp := SOAP.Message.Response.From (Payload);

   Resp_Params := +I (My_Int * 2, "answer");

   SOAP.Message.Set_Parameters (Resp, Resp_Params);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

This build a response which is a single integer value named
@code{answer} with the value @code{My_Int * 2}.

@sp 1
@item Returns the answer back to the client
@sp 1

@noindent
This last step will encode the response object in @code{XML} and will
returns it as the body of an @code{HTTP} message.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{return} SOAP.Message.Response.Build (Resp);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@end enumerate

@node SOAP helpers
@subsection @code{SOAP} helpers

@noindent
There is two ways to help building the @code{SOAP}
callbacks. @code{AWS} provides a @code{SOAP} specific callback, the spec is :

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} SOAP_Callback 
  (SOAPAction : @b{in} String;
   Payload    : @b{in} Message.Payload.Object;
   Request    : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data)
   @b{return} AWS.Response.Data;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
With both solutions exposed below, @code{AWS} retrieve the
@code{SOAPAction} and the Payload from the @code{SOAP} request. This
is transparent to the user.

@enumerate

@item Using Utils.SOAP_Wrapper
@cindex Utils.SOAP_Wrapper

@noindent
It is possible to dispatch to such callback by using the
@code{SOAP.Utils.SOAP_Wrapper} generic routine.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{generic}
   @b{with function} SOAP_CB
     (SOAPAction : @b{in} String;
      Payload    : @b{in} Message.Payload.Object;
      Request    : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data)
      @b{return} AWS.Response.Data;
@b{function} SOAP_Wrapper
  (Request : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data)
   @b{return} AWS.Response.Data;
@i{--  From a standard HTTP callback call the SOAP callback passed as generic}
@i{--  formal procedure. Raise Constraint_Error if Request is not a SOAP}
@i{--  request.}
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

For example, from the standard HTTP callback @code{CB} we want to call
@code{SOAP_CB} for all @code{SOAP} requests:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} SOAP_CB 
  (SOAPAction : @b{in} String;
   Payload    : @b{in} Message.Payload.Object;
   Request    : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data)
   @b{return} AWS.Response.Data 
@b{is}
@b{begin}
   @i{--  Code here}
@b{end} SOAP_CB;

@b{procedure} SOAP_Wrapper @b{is new} SOAP.Utils.SOAP_Wrapper (SOAP_CB);

@b{function} CB (Request : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data) 
  @b{return} AWS.Response.Data 
@b{is}
   SOAPAction : @b{constant} String := Status.SOAPAction (Request);
@b{begin}
   @b{if} SOAPAction /= "" @b{then}
      SOAP_Wrapper (Request);
   @b{else}
      ...
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item Using a SOAP Dispatcher
@cindex SOAP Dispatcher

@noindent
@code{AWS} provides also a @code{SOAP} specific dispatcher. This
dispatcher will automatically calls a standard @code{HTTP} or
@code{SOAP} callback depending on the request. If @code{SOAPAction} is
specified (i.e. it is a @code{SOAP} request), the dispatcher will call
the @code{SOAP} callback otherwise it will call the standard @code{HTTP}
callback. This is by far the easiest integration procedure. Using
dispatcher the above code will be written:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} SOAP_CB 
  (SOAPAction : @b{in} String;
   Payload    : @b{in} Message.Payload.Object;
   Request    : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data)
   @b{return} AWS.Response.Data 
@b{is}
@b{begin}
   @i{--  Code here}
@b{end} SOAP_CB;

@b{function} CB (Request : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data) 
  @b{return} AWS.Response.Data 
@b{is}
   SOAPAction : @b{constant} String := Status.SOAPAction (Request);
@b{begin}
   @i{--  Code here}
@b{end} CB;

@i{--  In the main procedure}

@b{begin}
   AWS.Server.Start
     (WS,
      Dispatcher => 
        SOAP.Dispatchers.Callback.Create (CB'Access, SOAP_CB'Access),
      Config     => 
        AWS.Config.Default_Config);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
@cindex SOAP.Dispatchers.Callback
The dispacther is created using @code{SOAP.Dispatchers.Callback.Create}. 
This routine takes two parameters, one is the standard HTTP
callback procedure and the other is the @code{SOAP} callback procedure.

@code{WSDL} (Web Service Definition Language) is an @code{XML} based document
which described a set of Web Services either based on @code{SOAP} or
@code{XML/RPC}.
By using a @code{WSDL} document it is possible to describe, in a formal way,
the interface to any Web Services. The @code{WSDL} document contains the
end-point (URL to the server offering the service), the @code{SOAPAction}
(needed to call the right routine), the procedure names and a
description of the input and output parameters.

@noindent
@code{AWS} provides two tools to work with @code{WSDL} documents:

@table @file
@item ada2wsdl
@cindex ada2wsdl
which creates a @code{WSDL} document from an Ada package spec.

@item wsdl2aws
@cindex wsdl2aws
which create the interfaces
to use a Web Service or to implement Web Services. With this tool the
@code{SOAP} interface is completely abstracted out, users will deal only
with @code{Ada} API. All the @code{SOAP} marshaling will be created

is that in Ada a function does not have a named return parameter,
@file{ada2wsdl} use @b{Result} for the response. Both the input and
output parameter are mapped to @code{SOAP} @code{xsd:int} type.

@noindent
Note that the @code{SOAP} address generated by default (http://.../)
must be edited manually or specified using @file{ada2wsdl}'s -a
option.

@noindent
This is of course a very simple example. @code{ada2wsdl} does support lot
more complex specs and will map Ada records, arrays, enumerations,
derived types to a corresponding @code{XML} schema definition. See
section below for a description of the mapping.

@node Ada mapping to WSDL
@subsection Ada mapping to WSDL

@code{ada2wsdl} parse Ada records, arrays, derived types, enumerations,
procedures and functions and generate the corresponding @code{WSDL}
document. In this section we describe the mapping between Ada and
@code{WSDL}.

@table @b
@item Integer
Mapped to @b{xsd:int}.

@item Float
Mapped to @b{xsd:float}. Note that @code{Float} type should not be used
as xsd:float is really an Ada @code{Long_Float}. @file{ada2wsdl} will
issue a warning if such type is used. Note also that full
interoperability is not supported for type @code{Float}.

@item Long_Float
Mapped to @b{xsd:float}

@item Long_Long_Float
Mapped to @b{xsd:double}

@item Boolean
Mapped to @b{xsd:boolean}

@item String
Mapped to @b{xsd:string}

@item Unbounded_String
Mapped to @b{xsd:string}, note that Unbounded_String should be used
only inside a record for full interoperability. This is a current limitation.

@item Character
Mapped to a Character schema definition.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
<simpleType name="Character">
   <restriction base="xsd:string">
      <length value="1"/>
   </restriction>
</simpleType>
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item SOAP.Utils.SOAP_Base64
Mapped to @b{xsd:base64Binary}. @code{SOAP.Utils.SOAP_Base64} is a
subtype of string which is is recognized by @code{ada2wsdl} to
generate the proper SOAP type.

@item Enumerations
Mapped to an enumeration schema definition. For example:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
type Color is (Red, Green, Blue);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

is defined as:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
<simpleType name="Color">
   <restriction base="xsd:string">
      <enumeration value="Red"/>
      <enumeration value="Green"/>
      <enumeration value="Blue"/>
   </restriction>
</simpleType>
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item Records
Mapped to an struct schema definition. For example:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{type} Rec @b{is record}
   A : Integer;
   B : Long_Float;
   C : Long_Long_Float;
   D : Character;
   E : Unbounded_String;
   F : Boolean;
@b{end record};
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

is defined as:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
<complexType name="Rec">
   <all>
      <element name="A" type="xsd:int"/>
      <element name="B" type="xsd:float"/>
      <element name="C" type="xsd:double"/>
      <element name="D" type="tns:Character"/>
      <element name="E" type="xsd:string"/>
      <element name="F" type="xsd:boolean"/>
   </all>
</complexType>
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item Arrays
Mapped to an array schema definition. For example:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{type} Set_Of_Rec @b{is array} (Positive @b{range} <>) @b{of} Rec;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

is defined as:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
<complexType name="Set_Of_Rec">
   <complexContent>
      <restriction base="soap-enc:Array">
         <attribute ref="soap-enc:arrayType" wsdl:arrayType="tns:Rec[]"/>
      </restriction>
   </complexContent>
</complexType>
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item Array inside a record
This part is a bit delicate. A record field must be constrained but a
@code{SOAP} arrays is most of the time not constrained at all. To
support this @code{AWS} use a safe access array component. Such a type
is built using a generic runtime support package named
@code{SOAP.Utils.Safe_Pointers}. This package implements a reference
counter for the array access and will release automatically the memory
when no more reference exists for a given object.

For example, let's say that we have an array of integer that we want
to put inside a record:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{type} Set_Of_Int @b{is array} (Positive @b{range} <>) @b{of} Integer;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

The first step is to create the safe array access support:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{type} Set_Of_Int_Access @b{is access} Set_Of_Int;

@b{package} Set_Of_Int_Safe_Pointer @b{is}
   @b{new} SOAP.Utils.Safe_Pointers (Set_Of_Int, Set_Of_Int_Access);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

Note that the name @code{Set_Of_Int_Safe_Pointer} (@i{<type>_Safe_Pointer})
is mandatory (and checked by @file{ada2wsdl}) to achieve
interoperability with @file{wsdl2aws}. @pxref{Working with WSDL documents}.

From there the safe array access can be placed into the record:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{type} Complex_Rec @b{is record}
   SI : Set_Of_Int_Safe_Pointer.Safe_Pointer;
@b{end record};
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

To create a Safe_Pointer given a @code{Set_Of_Int} one must use
@code{Set_Of_Int_Safe_Pointer.To_Safe_Pointer} routine. Accessing
individual items is done with @code{SI.Item (K)}.

These Ada definitions are full recognized by @file{ada2wsdl} and will
generate standard array and record @code{WSDL} definitions as seen above.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
<complexType name="Set_Of_Int">
   <complexContent>
      <restriction base="soap-enc:Array">
         <attribute ref="soap-enc:arrayType" wsdl:arrayType="xsd:int[]"/>
      </restriction>
   </complexContent>

@node Client side (stub)
@subsection Client side (stub)
@cindex WSDL, Client

@noindent
This section describe how to use a Web Service. Let's say that we want
to use the Barnes & Noble Price Quote service. The WSDL document for
this service can be found at 
@url{http://www.xmethods.net/sd/2001/BNQuoteService.wsdl}. In summary
this document says that there is a service named @code{getPrice}
taking as input a string representing the ISBN number and returning
the price as floating point.

The first step is to generate the client interface (stub):

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ wsdl2aws -noskel http://www.xmethods.net/sd/2001/BNQuoteService.wsdl
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
This will create many files, the interesting one at this point is
@file{bnquoteservice-client.ads}, inside we have:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} getPrice
  (isbn : @b{in} String)
   @b{return} Long_Float;
--  @i{Raises SOAP.SOAP_Error if the procedure fails}
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Let's call this service to find out the price for
@i{The Sword of Shannara Trilogy} book.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{with} Ada.Text_IO;
@b{with} BNQuoteService.Client;

@b{procedure} Price @b{is}
   @b{use} Ada;

   ISBN : @b{constant} String := "0345453751";
   --  @i{The Sword of Shannara Trilogy ISBN}

   @b{package} LFIO @b{is new} Text_IO.Float_IO (Long_Float);

@b{begin}
   Text_IO.Put_Line ("B&N Price for The Sword of Shannara Trilogy");
   LFIO.Put (BNQuoteService.Client.getPrice (ISBN), Aft => 2, Exp => 0);
@b{end} Price;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
That's all is needed to use this Web Service. This program is fully
functional, It is possible to build it and to run it to get the answer.

@node Server side (skeleton)
@subsection Server side (skeleton)
@cindex WSDL, Server

@noindent
Building a Web Service can also be done from a @code{WSDL} document. Let's
say that you are Barnes & Noble and that you want to build Web Service
@code{getPrice} as described in the previous section. 

@noindent
You have created the @code{WSDL} document to specify the service spec.
From there you can create the skeleton:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ wsdl2aws -nostub http://www.xmethods.net/sd/2001/BNQuoteService.wsdl
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
This will create many files, the interesting one here is 
@file{bnquoteservice-server.ads}, inside we have:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Port : @b{constant} := 80;

@b{generic}
  @b{with function} getPrice
  (isbn : @b{in} String)
   @b{return} Long_Float;
@b{function} getPrice_CB
  (SOAPAction : @b{in} String;
   Payload    : @b{in} SOAP.Message.Payload.Object;
   Request    : @b{in} AWS.Status.Data)
   @b{return} AWS.Response.Data;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
This is a @code{SOAP AWS}'s callback routine that can be instantiated
with the right routine to retrieve the price of a book given its ISBN
number. A possible implementation of such routine could be:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} getPrice
  (isbn : @b{in} String)
   @b{return} Long_Float @b{is}
@b{begin}
   @b{if} isbn = "0987654321" @b{then}
      return 45.0;
   @b{elsif} ...
@b{end} getPrice;

@b{function} SOAP_getPrice @b{is new} BNQuoteService.Server.getPrice_CB (getPrice);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
@code{SOAP_getPrice} is a @code{SOAP AWS}'s callback routine (i.e. it is not
a standard callback). To use it there is different solutions:

@table @b

@item Using SOAP.Utils.SOAP_Wrapper
This generic function can be used to translate a standard callback
based on @code{AWS.Status.Data} into a @code{SOAP} callback routine.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} getPrice_Wrapper @b{is new} SOAP.Utils.SOAP_Wrapper (SOAP_getPrice);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
The routine @code{getPrice_Wrapper} can be used as any other AWS's
callback routines. Note that inside this wrapper the @code{XML} payload is
parsed to check the routine name and to retrieve the @code{SOAP}
parameters. To call this routine the payload needs to be parsed (we
need to know which routine has be invoked). In this case we have
parsed the @code{XML} payload twice, this is not efficient.

@item Building the wrapper yourself

@noindent
This solution is more efficient if there is many @code{SOAP}
procedures as the payload is parsed only once.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{function} CB (Request : @b{in} Status.Data) @b{return} Response.Data @b{is}
   SOAPAction : @b{constant} String := Status.SOAPAction (Request);
   Payload    : @b{constant} SOAP.Message.Payload.Object
     := SOAP.Message.XML.Load_Payload (AWS.Status.Payload (Request));
   Proc       : @b{constant} String
     := SOAP.Message.Payload.Procedure_Name (Payload);
@b{begin}
   @b{if} SOAPAction = "..." @b{then}

      @b{if} Proc = "getPrice" @b{then}
         @b{return} SOAP_getPrice (SOAPAction, Payload, Request);
      @b{elsif} ...
         ...
      @b{end if};

   @b{else}
      ...
   @b{end if};
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@end table

@noindent
Note that the port to be used by the AWS server is described into the
server spec.

@node wsdl2aws
@subsection wsdl2aws
@cindex wsdl2aws

@smallexample
Usage: wsdl2aws [options] <file|URL>
@end smallexample

It is possible to pass a @code{WSDL} file or direct @file{wsdl2aws} to
a @code{WSDL} document on the Web by passing it's @code{URL}.

@noindent
@code{wsdl2aws} options are:

@table @b
@item -q
Quiet mode (no output)

@item -a
Generate using Ada style names. For example @code{getPrice} will be converted
to @code{Get_Price}. This formatting is done for packages, routines and formal
parameters.

@item -f
Force creation of the file. Overwrite any exiting files with the same
name.

@item -s
Skip non supported @code{SOAP} routines. If @code{-s} is not used,
@code{wsdl2aws} will exit with an error when a problem is found while
parsing the @code{WSDL} document. This option is useful to skip
routines using non supported types and still be able to compile the
generated files.

@item -o name
Specify the name of the local @code{WSDL} document. This option can be used
only when using a Web @code{WSDL} document (i.e. passing an URL to 
@code{wsdl2aws}).

@item -doc
Handle document style binding as RPC ones. This is sometimes needed
because some @code{WSDL} document specify a document style binding even
though it is really an RPC one.

@item -v
Verbose mode, display the parsed spec.

@item -v -v
Verbose mode, display the parsed spec and lot of information while
parsing the @code{WSDL} document tree.

@item -wsdl
Add @code{WSDL} document as comment into the generated root unit.

@item -cvs
Add CVS d tag in every generated file.

@item -nostub
Do not generated stubs, only skeletons are generated.

@item -noskel
Do not generated skeletons, only stubs are generated.

@item -cb
Generate a @code{SOAP} dispatcher callback routine for the
server. This dispatcher routine contains the code to handle all the
operations as described in the @code{WSDL} document. You need also to
specify the @code{-types} option, see below.

@item -types spec
Specify the name of the spec containing the Ada implementation of the
@code{SOAP} routines. This is used for example by the @code{-cb} option above
to instantiate all the server side @code{SOAP} callbacks used by the main
@code{SOAP} dispatcher routine.

@item -main filename
Specify the name of the server's procedure main to generate. If
file @file{<filename>.amt} (Ada Main Template) is present, it uses this
template file to generate the main procedure. The template can
reference the following variable tags:

@table @b
@item SOAP_SERVICE
The name of the service as described into the @code{WSDL}
document. This tag can be used to include the right units

@item <root>
This is the main package, it contains eventually the full @code{WSDL} in
comment and the description of the services as read from the @code{WSDL}
document.

@item <root>.Types
This package contains the definitions of the types which are not @code{SOAP}
base types. We find here the definitions of the @code{SOAP} structs and arrays
with routines to convert them between the Ada and @code{SOAP} type model. A
subtype definition is also created for every routine's returned type.

@item <root>.Client
All spec to call Web Services.

@item <root>.Server
All spec to build Web Services. These specs are all generic and must
be instantiated with the right routine to create the web services.

@item <root>.CB

@node Using ada2wsdl and wsdl2aws together
@section Using ada2wsdl and wsdl2aws together

@noindent
Using both tools together is an effective way to build rapidely a @code{SOAP}

take the following spec:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{package} Graphics @b{is}

   @b{type} Point @b{is} record
      X, Y : Long_Float;

   --  @i{Returns the distance between points P1 and P2}

@b{end} Graphics;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
We do not show the body here but we suppose it is implemented. To
build a server for this service it is as easy as:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ ada2wsdl -a http://localhost:8787 -o graphics.wsdl graphics.ads
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
The server will be available on localhost at port 8787.

@smallexample

@node Sending e-mail
@section Sending e-mail
@cindex Sending e-mail
@cindex SMTP
@cindex Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

@noindent
@code{AWS} provides a complete API to send e-mail using @code{SMTP}
protocol. You need to have access to an SMTP server to use this
feature. The API covers sending simple mail with text message and/or
with @code{MIME} attachments (base64 encoded). Here are the steps to
send a simple e-mail:

@itemize @bullet

@item Initialize the SMTP server

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
SMTP_Server : SMTP.Receiver 
   := SMTP.Client.Initialize ("smtp.hostname");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

Here @code{AWS} uses the default SMTP port to create an SMTP mail server but
it is possible to specify a different one. The hostname specified
must be a valid SMTP server.

@item Send the e-mail

@sp 1
To send an e-mail there is many different API. Let's send a simple text mail.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Status : SMTP.Status;

SMTP.Client.Send 
  (SMTP_Server,
   From    => SMTP.E_Mail ("Pascal Obry", "p.obry@@wanadoo.fr"),
   To      => SMTP.E_Mail ("John Doe", "john.doe@@here.com"),
   Subject => "About AWS SMTP protocol",
   Message => "AWS can now send mails",
   Status  => Status);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Here Status will contain the SMTP returned status.

@item Check that everything is ok

@sp 1
@noindent
Using above status data it is possible to check that the message was
sent or not by the server. The status contain a code and an error
message, both of them can be retrieved using specific routines,
@xref{AWS.SMTP}. It is also possible to check that the call was
successful with @code{SMTP.Is_Ok} routine.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{if not} SMTP.Is_Ok (Status) @b{then}
   Put_Line ("Can't send message: " & SMTP.Status_Message (Status));
@b{end if};
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@end itemize

@noindent
In the above example, the message content was given as a string but it
is possible to specify a disk file. @code{AWS} can also send MIME messages
either from disk files or with in memory base64 encoded binary
data. The API provides also a way to send messages to multiple
recipients at the same time. These features are not described here,
complete documentation can be found on the spec @pxref{AWS.SMTP} and
@pxref{AWS.SMTP.Client}.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Retrieving e-mail
@section Retrieving e-mail
@cindex Retrieving e-mail
@cindex POP
@cindex Post Office Protocol

@noindent
@code{AWS} provides an API to retrieve e-mails from a @code{POP}
mailbox. @code{POP} stands for @i{Post Office Protocol} and is the main
protocol used by Internet Service Providers around the
world. @code{IMAP} is another well known protocol in this area but it
is not supported by @code{AWS}.

@noindent
We describes here the @code{POP} API. For a complete description see
@pxref{AWS.POP}.

@itemize @bullet

@item Opening the mailbox

@noindent
The first step is to authenticate using a user name and
password. @code{AWS} supports two methods one called @code{Clear_Text}
which is the most used and another one @code{APOP} which is more secure but
almost not supported by @code{ISP} for the moment (and will probably
never be supported as a more secure protocol named @code{SPA} -Secure
Password Authentication- could be used instead).

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Mailbox : POP.Mailbox
   := POP.Initialize ("pop.hostname", "john.does", "mysuperpwd");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
The default Authentication method is @code{Clear_Text}.

@item Getting mailbox information

@noindent
When the connection is opened it is possible to get information about
the mailbox like the number of messages or the total number of bytes
in the mailbox.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
N     : @b{constant} Natural := POP.Message_Count (Mailbox);

Bytes : @b{constant} Natural := POP.Size (Mailbox);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item Retreiving individual e-mail

@noindent
Each message is numbered starting from 1. A function named @code{Get}
will return a message given its mailbox's number.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Message : @b{constant} POP.Message := POP.Get (Mailbox, 2, Remove => True);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
Remove can be set to @code{False} for the message to stay on the
mailbox. The default value is @code{False}.

@item Iterating through the mailbox content

@noindent
Another way to retreive message is by using an iterator.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{procedure} Print_Subject
  (Message : @b{in}     POP.Message
   Index   : @b{in}     Positive;
   Quit    : @b{in out} Boolean) @b{is}

@node LDAP
@chapter LDAP
@cindex LDAP
@cindex LDAP Directory
@cindex Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

@noindent
@code{AWS} provides a complete API to retrieve information from LDAP servers.
Note that there is no support for updating, modifying or deleting
information only to read information from the server.

@sp 1
@noindent
The @code{AWS/LDAP} implementation is based on @code{OpenLDAP}. To
build an LDAP application you need to link with the @file{libldap.a}
library. This library is built by @code{AWS} on Windows based system
and will use the @file{wldap32.dll} as provided with Windows
NT/2000/XP. On UNIX based systems, you must install properly the
@code{OpenLDAP} package.

@noindent
The steps required to read information from an LDAP server are:

@table @b

@item Initialize the LDAP directory

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{declare}
   Directory : LDAP.Client.Directory;
@b{begin}
   Directory := LDAP.Client.Init (Host);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

Host is the hostname where the LDAP directory is running. It is
possible to specify the port if the LDAP server does not use the
default one.

@item Bind to the LDAP server

This step is the way to pass a login/password if the LDAP server
required an authentication. If not, the login/password must be empty strings.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
LDAP.Client.Bind (Directory, "", "");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item Do the search

@noindent
For the search you must specify the base name, a filter, the scope and
a set of attributes to retrieve.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Response_Set := LDAP.Client.Search
  (Directory, Base_DN, Filter, LDAP.Client.LDAP_Scope_Subtree,
   LDAP.Client.Attributes
     ("cn", "sn", "telephonenumber"));
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@table @b
@item Attributes
The set of attributes to retrieve from the directory.
@item Filter
A set of values for some attributes. A filter is <attribute_name>=<value>
where value can contain '*' at the end. For example "(cn=DUPON*)" will
look for all entries where the common name is starting by the string "DUPON".
@item Scope
Define how far in the hierarchical directory the search will
operate. It is either one level, all subtrees or on the base of the tree.
@end table

@noindent
For more information @pxref{AWS.LDAP.Client}.

@item Iterate through the response set

@noindent
For this there is two iterators. @code{First_Entry}/@code{Next_Entry} or the
generic high level iterator @code{For_Every_Entry}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{declare}
   Message : LDAP.Client.LDAP_Message;
@b{begin}
   Message := LDAP.Client.First_Entry (Directory, Response_Set);

   @b{while} Message /= LDAP.Client.Null_LDAP_Message @b{loop}

      Do_Job (Message);

      Message := LDAP.Client.Next_Entry (Directory, Message);
   @b{end loop};
@b{end};
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item Read attributes for each entry

@noindent
Each entry has an associated set of attributes. To retrieve attributes
values there is two iterators. @code{First_Attribute} / @code{Next_Attribute}
or the generic high level iterator @code{For_Every_Attribute}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
@b{declare}
   BER : @b{aliased} LDAP.Client.BER_Element;

   Attr : @b{constant} String := LDAP.Client.First_Attribute
     (Directory, Message, BER'Unchecked_Access);
@b{begin}
   Do_Job (Attr);

   @b{loop}
      @b{declare}
         Attr : @b{constant} String := LDAP.Client.Next_Attribute
          (Directory, Message, BER);
      @b{begin}
         @b{exit when} Attr = "";
         Do_Job (Attr);
      @b{end};
  @b{end loop};
@b{end};
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item Cleanup

@noindent
At the end of the processing it is important to release memory
associated with LDAP objects.

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
LDAP.Client.Free (Message);
LDAP.Client.Unbind (Directory);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@end table

@sp 1
@noindent
@pxref{AWS.LDAP.Client} for all high level supported API and documentation.

@noindent
Note that for complete information about @code{AWS/LDAP} you you should read
an LDAP API description. @code{AWS/LDAP} is only a binding and follow the
LDAP API closely.

@node Jabber
@chapter Jabber
@cindex Jabber

@noindent
@code{AWS} support part of the Jabber protocol. At this stage only two kind
of messages are supported:

@enumerate

@item Presence

To check the presence status of a specific JID (Jabber ID)

@item Message

To send messages to a specific JID (Jabber ID)

@end enumerate

@noindent
Note that if you want an application to check the presence or send
message to users it is recommended to create a specific Jabber ID on the
server for this application and ask users to accept this specific user
to check their presence status.

@menu
* Jabber presence::
* Jabber message::
@end menu

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Jabber presence
@section Jabber presence
@cindex Jabber presence

@noindent
To check for the presence of another JID you must first have the right
to do so. The jabber server won't let you see presence of another JID
unless the JID have permitted you to see its presence.

@itemize @bullet

@item First declare the server and status objects

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Server : AWS.Jabber.Server;
Status : AWS.Jabber.Presence_Status;
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item Connect to the server, you must have an account created and must
know the login and password

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
AWS.Jabber.Connect
  (Server, "jabber.domain.org", "joe", "mysuperpwd");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item Then, to check the presence of user "john"

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
AWS.Jabber.Check_Presence
  (Server, "john@@jabber.domain.org", Status);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item Then, you just have to close the server

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
AWS.Jabber.Close (Server);
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@end itemize

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Jabber message
@section Jabber message
@cindex Jabber message

@noindent
To send a message to a specific JID, you must connect to
the server as above and close the server when you don't need to
communicate with it anymore. The only different part is to send the
message, here is an example:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
Send_Message
   (Server,
    JID     => "john@@jabber.domain.org",
    Subject => "Hello there!",
    Content => "Are you using AWS ?");
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
It is as simple as that !

@c ======================================================================

@node Resources
@chapter Resources
@cindex Resources
@cindex Self dependant

@noindent
@code{AWS} support embedded resources. It means that it is possible to build
a fully self dependent executable. This is useful when distributing a
server. The server program contains the code but also the images (PNG,
JPEG, GIF), the templates, the HTML pages... more generally any file the
Web Server must serve to clients.

@menu
* Building resources::
* Using resources::
* Stream resources::
* awsres tool::
@end menu

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Building resources
@section Building resources
@cindex Building resources

@noindent
To embbed the files into the executable you must build a resource
tree. This task is greatly simplified using @file{AWSRes} tool. For
example let's say that you want to build a simple server with a single
page containing some text and one PNG image. The text is handled
directly in the callback procedure and contain a reference to the
image @file{logo.png}. To build the resource tree:

@smallexample
@cartouche
@group
$ awsres logo.png
@end group
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent
This will create a set of packages whose root is the unit @code{res} by
default. The resource tree is created. @pxref{awsres tool} for the complete
AWS's usage description.

@noindent
@code{awsres} can also compress the resource files. This can be done
by using @code{awsres}'s @code{-z} option. Compressed resources are
handled transparently. If the Web client supports compression the
resource is sent as-is otherwise a decompression stream will be
created for the resource to be decompressed on-the-fly while sending it.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Using resources
@section Using resources
@cindex Using resources

@noindent
This is really the simplest step. The resource tree must be linked
with your executable, to do so you just have to ``with'' the
resource tree root into one of your program unit. This will ensure
that the resource tree will be compiled and linked into the
executable. @code{AWS} and @code{Templates_Parser know} about resource
files and will pick them up if available.

@noindent
Note that this is transparent to users. It is possible to build the
very same server based on standard files or resources files. The only
change in the code is to ``with'' or not the resource tree.

@noindent
Note that @code{AWS} supports only a single resource tree. If more
than one resource tree is included into a program only one will be
seen.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Stream resources
@section Stream resources
@cindex Stream resources

@noindent
Users can build a response directly from a stream. In this case the
callback answer is built using @code{AWS.Response.Stream}. It creates a
resource object whose operations have been inherited from
@code{AWS.Resource.Stream.Stream_Type} and redefined by the user. So
the @code{Read} operation can dynamically create the result stream
data, the @code{End_Of_File} operation must returns @code{True} when the
stream data is out and so on. This feature is useful to let users completely
create and control dynamically @code{AWS}'s response content.

@pxref{AWS.Resources.Streams}.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node awsres tool
@section awsres tool
@cindex awsres

@noindent
@code{AWSRes} is a tool to build resource files. It creates a root package
named @file{res} by default and a child package for each resource
file.

@noindent
Usage: awsres [-hrquz] file1 [-uz] [file2...]

@table @code

@item -h
Display help message.

@item -q
Quiet mode.

@item -r name
Set the root unit name. Default is @code{res}.

@item -u
Add following files as uncompressed resources.

@item -z
Add following files as compressed resources.

@end table

@c ======================================================================

@node Status page
@chapter Status page
@cindex Status

@noindent
The status page gives information about the @code{AWS} internal status. For
example it returns the server socket ID, the number of simultaneous
connection, the number of time a connection has been used...

@noindent
To display the information @code{AWS} use a template file. The
template file (default is @file{@_STATUS_PAGE_@}) is an HTML file with
some specific tags recognized by the parser. For more information
about how the template parser works, please look for the template
parser documentation distributed with @code{AWS} or on the Web at
@url{http://perso.wanadoo.fr/} in the Ada section.
