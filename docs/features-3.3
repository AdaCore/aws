New features in AWS 3.3
-----------------------

NF-33-O122-046 Add support for documentation in WSDL (2015-02-18)

    AWS's wsdl2aws tool will now record the annotation/documentation
    nodes in the WSDL and generate comments out of them in the Ada
    generated code. These comments are handled for the WSDL operations
    and schema's types.

NF-33-O118-004 Add support for derived types (2015-01-18)

    AWS's wsdl2aws tool has now full support for derived types.
    The namespace for the parent type is properly used when generating
    the corresponding Ada code. This has make it possible to clean-up
    some old code to handle Ada Character mapping for example. Any
    type derivation level is properly handled.

NF-33-O118-003 Add support for external schema (2015-01-18)

    It is now possible to use WSDL with references to external
    schema. In this case, wsdl2aws tool, will check the schema
    locally and load it if found.

NF-33-NB18-024 Add support for schema root naming (2014-11-26)

    It is now possible to set the schema root name generated in the
    WSDL with ada2wsdl. This is needed when mixing multiple project
    to avoid name clashes. The same support has been added in the
    wsdl2aws tool to generate the sources under a specific prefix.
    Again this is to avoid name clashes when multiple Ada source
    codes are generated.
