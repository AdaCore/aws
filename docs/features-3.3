New features in AWS 3.3
-----------------------

NF-33-O202-019 Add explicit supprot for TLS 1.1 and 1.2 (2015-02-02)

    Allow explicit support for TLS 1.1 and 1.2 on OpenSSL. This also
    enable to restrict use of these specific protocols.

NF-33-O118-021 Add support for xs:choice in WSDL complexType (2015-01-31)

    AWS's wsdl2aws tool has now partial support for complexType with
    xs:choice items. This is mapped in Ada with a record with
    discriminant. Only a single occcurence of each item is supported
    by this implementation.

NF-33-O118-004 Add support for derived types (2015-01-18)

    AWS's wsdl2aws tool has now full support for derived types.
    The namespace for the parent type is properly used when generating
    the corresponding Ada code. This has make it possible to clean-up
    some old code to handle Ada Character mapping for example. Any
    type derivation level is properly handled.

NF-33-O118-003 Add support for external schema (2015-01-18)

    It is now possible to use WSDL with references to external
    schema. In this case, wsdl2aws tool, will check the schema
    locally and load it if found.

NF-33-NB18-024 Add support for schema root naming (2014-11-26)

    It is now possible to set the schema root name generated in the
    WSDL with ada2wsdl. This is needed when mixing multiple project
    to avoid name clashes. The same support has been added in the
    wsdl2aws tool to generate the sources under a specific prefix.
    Again this is to avoid name clashes when multiple Ada source
    codes are generated.
