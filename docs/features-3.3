New features in AWS 3.3
-----------------------

NF-33-O223-047 Add support for minOccurs/maxOccurs (2015-03-08)

    Add support for multi-occurrence SOAP elements. SOAP element
    declared with a minOccurs or maxOccurs different than 1 are now
    properly handled as multi-occurrence elements. If minOccurs is set
    to 0 the element can be omitted.

NF-33-O204-042 Add support for WSDL/SOAP type's constraints (2015-02-28)

    The tools ada2wsdl and wsdl2aws handle now the type constraints.
    That is, ada2wsdl will check for range attribute, mod for modular
    types and array index to generate the corresponding constraints in
    the WSDL using the simpleType Length, minInclusive and
    maxInclusive attributes. Those attributes (plus the  minExclusive
    and maxExclusive ones) are now used by wsdl2aws to generate Ada
    type constraints.

    Now a constrained string is generated instead of an
    Unbounded_String for a simpleType with a Length attribute whose
    base type is xsd:string.

    The simpleType Pattern attribute is now taken into account and a
    Dynamic_Predicate aspect is generated. For varying length string
    with attribute minLength and/or maxLength a Dynamic_Predicate
    aspect is also generated.

    Those now constraints will ensure that SOAP objects sent/received
    are not violating the constraints expressed into the WSDL making
    the new implementation safer.

NF-33-O202-019 Add explicit support for TLS 1.1 and 1.2 (2015-02-02)

    Allow explicit support for TLS 1.1 and 1.2 on OpenSSL. This also
    enable to restrict use of these specific protocols.

NF-33-O122-046 Add support for documentation in WSDL (2015-02-18)

    AWS's wsdl2aws tool will now record the annotation/documentation
    nodes in the WSDL and generate comments out of them in the Ada
    generated code. These comments are handled for the WSDL operations
    and schema's types.

NF-33-O118-021 Add support for xs:choice in WSDL complexType (2015-01-31)

    AWS's wsdl2aws tool has now partial support for complexType with
    xs:choice items. This is mapped in Ada with a record with
    discriminant. Only a single occcurence of each item is supported
    by this implementation.

NF-33-O118-004 Add support for derived types (2015-01-18)

    AWS's wsdl2aws tool has now full support for derived types.
    The namespace for the parent type is properly used when generating
    the corresponding Ada code. This has make it possible to clean-up
    some old code to handle Ada Character mapping for example. Any
    type derivation level is properly handled.

NF-33-O118-003 Add support for external schema (2015-01-18)

    It is now possible to use WSDL with references to external
    schema. In this case, wsdl2aws tool, will check the schema
    locally and load it if found.

NF-33-NB18-024 Add support for schema root naming (2014-11-26)

    It is now possible to set the schema root name generated in the
    WSDL with ada2wsdl. This is needed when mixing multiple project
    to avoid name clashes. The same support has been added in the
    wsdl2aws tool to generate the sources under a specific prefix.
    Again this is to avoid name clashes when multiple Ada source
    codes are generated.
