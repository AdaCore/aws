New features in AWS 3.2
-----------------------

NF-32-N607-008 Add support for WSDL extension (2014-06-07)

    WSDL extension are now recognized and wsdl2aws will generate
    proper Ada code.

NF-32-N327-008 Diffie-Hellman and RSA parameters generation (2014-03-06)

    Support for Diffie-Hellman and RSA parameters generation on server side.
    These parameters are automatically generated by AWS the first time. They
    can be regenerated at any time for security reasons if needed. The
    generated Diffie-Hellman parameters are saved in a file to be reused
    on next run as it is quite expensive to generate it every time at
    the start of an application.

NF-32-N327-007 Support for SSL/TLS session reuse (2014-03-18)

    AWS is now able to resume security sessions over the secure sockets.
    Session data are processed in two ways, either in server side session
    cache or in session tickets held on the client side (RFC 5077).

NF-32-N302-003 Add support for cipher priority (2014-03-02)

   It is now possible to specify the SSL/TLS sessionâ€™s handshake algorithms
   and options using the new configuration variable CIPHER_PRIORITIES.

NF-32-N227-068 Add support for controlling WebSocket handshake (2014-03-02)

   In the user's WebSocket factory it is now possible to return an
   AWS.Net.WebSocket.Handshake_Error.Object to reject the handshake.
   With such response it is possible to specify a specific status code
   and an associated reaso-phrase. The default status code is 403.

NF-32-N126-007 Add a way to initialize explicitly the SSL layer (2014-02-03)

   It is now possible to initialize explicitly the SSL layer default
   parameters (certificate filename, security mode, etc...). The
   default configuration is used for every secure socket created by AWS.

NF-32-MB08-003 Add support for status code when closing WebSocket (2014-02-02)

   It is now possible to close a WebSocket with a status code.
