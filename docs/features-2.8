New features in AWS 2.8.0
-------------------------

NF-28-J215-015 Updated Web_Block context accessible (2010-02-15)

   It is now possible to query the updated context in the Web_Block
   framework. This make it possible to do specialized actions after
   rendering a Web page (i.e. after evaluating all the web blocks).

NF-28-IC11-015 Port AWS to VxWorks (2009-12-24)

   AWS can now be used on VxWorks. The build procedure has been modified
   to be able to build the tools on the native platform and the libraries
   on the cross platform.

NF-28-IC10-001 Generate targetNamespace in schema when possible (2010-01-07)

   ada2wsdl now generates a targetNamespace attribute into the schema node
   when all children are using the same namespace. This is to work around a
   Microsoft .Net toolset bug/limitation where targetNamespace into shema
   definitions (simpleType, complexType) are not supported.
