Notes for developers
====================

-----
setup
-----

First of all, it is very important to properly set your name and email into
the repository. These information will be used for every commits.

   $ git config user.name "John Doe"
   $ git config user.email john.doe@whatever.com

-----------------
local style check
-----------------

To enable local style check, first get and compile style_checker:

   $ git clone git://github.com/TurboGit/style_checker.git
   $ cd style_checker
   $ make
   $ cp style_checker /path/to/bin

Then get the git-scripts repository:

   $ git clone git://github.com/TurboGit/git-scripts.git

Use the pre-commit script from git-scripts, on UNIX you can just use a
soft link:

   $ cd AWS/.git/hooks
   $ ln -s /path/to/git-scripts/pre-commit .

Finaly create a configuration into $HOME/.git-pre-commit, just copy paste
the following lines into your shell:

$ cd $HOME
$ cat > .git-pre-commit << EOF
REPOSIT_NAME=$1
OWEB="-H -cP -cY -l256"

case "$REPOSIT_NAME" in
   aws) CPYR="[[:space:]]Copyright[[:space:]]\(C\)[[:space:]]([12]\d\d\d-)?2\d\d\d,[[:space:]]AdaCore[[:space:]]"
        SC_OPTS="-ign out -ign tmplt -ign sed -ign txt \
        -lang TXML $OWEB -lang XML $OWEB -lang HTML $OWEB -lang XSD $OWEB \
        -lang CSS $OWEB -lang Ada -d -cp -cy -sp -gnat05 -sp -gnatyI -cf $CPYR \
        -lang makefile -cp -cy -cf $CPYR -lang Python -H"
        EXCLUDE="\(features\)"
        PSTATUS=true
        ;;
     *) PSTATUS=""
        ;;
esac
EOF

------
commit
------

The main working branch is named master. Releases are taken from this
branch. All the commits are to be done or merged there at some point.

Simple commits like a minor reformatting, a style fix can be made directly
on master branch:

   $ git checkout master
   $ git commit -m "..."
   $ git push origin

New features or fixes must be prepared on separate branches even if there
is a single commit. The naming convention for those branches are:

   topic/<developer_initials>/<name> (referred as branch_name in this document)

   e.g. topic/po/improve-build-procedure

   Branch name should be all lower case and use dash as word separator.

A patch-set must follow the following properties:

   - The first line of the commit log message must be a summary of the
     change. This first line is what is viewed in many Git output (log
     --oneline, cherry -v, etc...) and should be restricted to 80
     characters.

   - Actual work must be separated from minor reformating or style fixes
     which should be done on separate commits.

   - A work must be done on small and incremental commits. This is generally
     far easier to review than a large commit. For example if the
     implementation of a given feature required a new API, it required
     to have a commit adding the new API and then a commit implementing
     the feature and using this new API.

-------
merging
-------

When the branch is ready it is pushed to AWS repository for review:

   $ git push origin <branch_name>

When reviewed and accepted the branch is merged back (no fast forward)
into master:

   $ git checkout master
   $ git merge --log --no-ff <branch_name>

Merging is done by the AWS project manager. The topic/ prefix is to be
removed from the merge commit log.

Note that for a branch with a single commit a fast forward is allowed.

This work/review cycle will help having proper patch set (code,
documentation work, test and possibly feature or known-problem entries)
before merging. This is especially important to make it easier to merge
fixes in release branches.

When such branches are not needed anymore they are removed from the central
repository:

   $ git push origin :<branch_name>

----------------------
external contributions
----------------------

For developers without commit access to the main AWS repository the
contribution can be made by sending patches to the AWS-patches mailing-list.
For example to send the last three commits on the current branch:

   $ git send-email --to aws-patches@lists.forge.open-do.org HEAD~3

It is also possible to add a cover-letter to explain the goal of a
patch-set:

   $ git format-patch --cover-letter -3 -o tobesent
   $ edit tobesent/0000-cover-letter.patch
   $ git send-email --to aws-patches@lists.forge.open-do.org tobesent/*

Contributed code must follow the style described into style-guide document.

==============================
Notes on the releases handling
==============================

------
naming
------

AWS version number : X.Y
Release branch     : X
Tags               : X.Y

Where: X = <2-DIGITS-YEAR>
       Y = 0w on master
       Y = 0 for preview
       Y = 1,2 for minor releases

---------
branching
---------

When a release is about to be ready a branch is created (X):

   $ git branch 17 master

At this point some adjustments are needed:

   * on master

      $ git checkout master
      $ edit src/core/aws.ads (set proper version number X+1.0w)
      $ edit readme.txt (likewise + clean-up "Changes",
        "Non upward compatible changes" and "Obsolescent features" sections)
      $ clean docs/known-problems

   * on the branch

      $ git checkout 17
      $ git tag -a X.0
      $ edit src/core/aws.ads (set proper version number: X.0)
      $ edit readme.txt (likewise)

-------------
stabilization
-------------

If important fixes are made (committed on master) they are merged into this
branch:

   $ git merge --log --no-ff <branch_name>

For this, <branch_name> may have to be rebased on release branch:

   $ git rebase --onto 17 <branch_name>^ <branch_name>
   (if there is a single commit to be merged from <branch_name>)

When the release is fully ready a corresponding tag is created (X.1):

   $ git tag -a X.1
   $ git push --tags

If interim releases are needed to fix some important bugs, as before fixes
are committed to master and merged into the branch. The tags numbering will
then be 2.0.2, then 2.0.3 and so on.
