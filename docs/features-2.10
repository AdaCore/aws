New features in AWS 2.10
------------------------

NF-210-KA08-001 HTTP_Connection is now a controlled object

   The HTTP_Connection object is now controlled. The finalization ensure
   that the socket is properly closed. This avoids memory leak if close
   is not explicitly called.

   The Send_Buffer_Size server configuration parameter is to define the
   socket internal buffer size when sending data to the client. Using a
   bigger buffer increase the performance on slow or long distance
   connections. The default is set to 32k.

NF-210-K315-046 Make log file-name compatible with logrotate (2011-03-16)

   The log file-name's timestamp has been removed when Split_Mode is None.
   This makes the naming compatible with logrotate.

NF-210-JB05-029 Enhance MIME types support (2010-12-04)

   It is now possible to specify the name of the file containing the
   list of MIME types through the server configuration. A standard

NF-210-J930-037 Three new Ajax actions have been implemented (2010-10-01)

   It is now possible to disable/enable an entry in a form or to make it
   read-only/writable. The last action can be used to reset a form to
   its default values.
