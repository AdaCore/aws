Here a some notes about things to fix, ideas and potential features to be
implemented:

- correctly handle all Date/Time format, there is 3 of them:

  Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT   ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
  Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
  Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994        ; ANSI C's asctime() format

  (Nice to see that when designing an RFC they are considering the C way of
   doing things, seems completly awkward to me :)

  Actually only the first format is supported.

- support standard method encoding under HTTP/1.1 for small files instead of
  the chuncked encoding.

- digest authentication (only basic authentication is supported right
  now, which is to say no authentication at all :)

- implement multi-server with a dispatcher of request to build server which
  must support a lot of requests. Could be using GLADE or a standard
  redirector of request (using HTTP redirection).

- implement a Proxy server.

- better implementation for stream reading on file upload.

- change server parameters via the admin page (like the maximum number of
  connections, server name, active session, upload path...).

- Thread Pool management (dynamically adding lines if needed...)

- Make the Session management a separate partition to be able to share the
  session data across the network. Something needed to do load balancing into
  a Web Farm.

- More transparent SOAP support. It would be nice to be able to generate
  stub/squeleton from a spec file (this work could reuse the gnatstub ASIS
  appication).

- Will be nice to add all timeouts to the AWS status page.

- Will be nice to have AWS.Client.Get follow the redirection if requested.

- We need to add the directory browser template into the config file.

- Replace OpenSSL by GNUTLS library when this library will become stable.

- Would be nice to handle the logging of errors.

- Would be nice to detect if users try to use the session feature when there
  is no session active in the server.

- Check that the socket layer support SSL when asking for SSL support. At the
  moment we have an exception with a traceback, it would be good to have a
  nice message explaining the problem.

- Would be nice to have an ActiveX component to support Server Push on
  Internet Explorer.

- Would be nice to have a very light version of the Web Server - LAWS for
  Light Ada Web Server - this will be a nice solution for the communication
  sub-system. A LAWS would have only one task, no file-upload, not all the
  mechanisms to handle the concurrency...

- Support socket timeout options (send and receive timeout) at the OS
  level. Right now a task is doing the job.

- Support compress/gzip encoding if client sypport it.

- Sort out problem with client socket that are not closed and can't be
  reused. This happen if a lot of requests are done to the server.

- Cookie for the session is set for the whole site (path=/), would be nice to
  have a way to configure that.
