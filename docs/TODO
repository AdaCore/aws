Here a some notes about things to fix, ideas and potential features to be
implemented:

- look at the GMT/UTC vs Local time issue.

- correctly handle all Date/Time format, there is 3 of them:

  Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT   ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
  Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
  Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994        ; ANSI C's asctime() format

  (Nice to see that when designing an RFC there are considering the C way of
   doing things, seems completly awkward to me :)

  Actually only the first format is supported.

- integrate Template_Parser with AWS. A callback which knows how to parse
  .tmplt files ???

- support standard method encoding under HTTP/1.1 for small files instead of
  the chuncked encoding.

- add support for multi-callbacks (calling a callback depending on a regular
  expression). A default callback procedure which act as a file server could
  be provided. Could be a way to integrate templates (see above) ?

- digest authentification (only basic authentification is supported right
  now).

- implement multi-server with a dispatcher of request to build server which
  must support a lot of requests. Could be using GLADE or a standard
  redirector of request.
