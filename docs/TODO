Here a some notes about things to fix, ideas and potential features to be
implemented:

- correctly handle all Date/Time format, there is 3 of them:

  Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT   ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
  Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
  Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994        ; ANSI C's asctime() format

  (Nice to see that when designing an RFC they are considering the C way of
   doing things, seems completly awkward to me :)

  Actually only the first format is supported.

- support standard method encoding under HTTP/1.1 for small files instead of
  the chuncked encoding.

- digest authentification (only basic authentification is supported right
  now, which is to say no authentification at all :)

- implement multi-server with a dispatcher of request to build server which
  must support a lot of requests. Could be using GLADE or a standard
  redirector of request (using HTTP redirection).

- implement a Proxy server.

- better implementation for stream reading on file upload.

- implement server push

- change server parameters via the admin page (like the maximum number of
  connections, server name, active session, upload path...).

- Thread Pool management (dynamically adding lines if needed...)

- Make the Session management a separate partition to be able to share the
  session data across the network. Something needed to do load balancing into
  a Web Farm.

- Support SOAP and Web-Service framework.

- Will be nice to add all timeouts to the AWS status page.

- Will be nice to have AWS.Client.Get follow the redirection if requested.
