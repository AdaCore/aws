Known Problems fixed in AWS 3.1

- MA04-027: Handle installation in different drives on Windows
  Problem: It is not possible to use AWS on a project when not
           installed on the same drive.
  Workaround: Install AWS with by specifying the drive letter for the
              prefix during setup.

- MA03-072: Filers in macro expressions
  Problem: Filters in macro expressions where not properly parsed and
           evaluated. This could cause a PROGRAM_ERROR or a wrong
           evaluation of the conditional expression to FALSE.
  Workaround: Expand the code manually instead of using a MACRO

- M802-001: Make sure all data are sent on slow OpenSSL connection
  Problem:    On slow connection (~ 100Kbit/s) under MacOS-X the
              last chunk of data in an OpenSSL connection could remain
              into the SSL buffer and never sent to the client.
  Workaround: None

- M527-001: Better respect the WebSocket RFC
  Problem:    WebSocket requests with large messages or sent in multiple
              chunks are not handled properly.
  Workaround: None

- M517-012: Fix parsing of URL parameters with no value
  Problem:    A parameter in an URL with no value is not correctly parsed if
              it is the last parameter.
  Workaround: Parse the URL manually or add the parameter manually after
              parsing.

- M325-036: Fix memory leak when handling malformed SOAP document
  Problem:    If an exception is raised while parsing a malformed SOAP
              document, the corresponding XML tree is not properly freed.
  Workaround: Make sure the SOAP document is valid.

- LB19-029: Max-Age cookie attribute does non conform to RFC-6265
  Problem:    Max-Age cookie attribute must be an integral number
              as specified in the RFC-6265 (2011). Note that the
              definition has changed as previous RFCs 2109 (1997) and
              RFC-2965 (2000) were still defining Max-Age as delta-seconds.
  Workaround: Do not use Opera browser which enforces this rule.

- LB06-009: Memory leak in AWS.Client.LDAP.Bind
  Problem:    When the connection is rejected it is not possible to
              reclaim the memory associated with the LDAP structure.
  Workaround: Copy the LDAP structure before calling Bind.
