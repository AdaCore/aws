Known Problems fixed in AWS 17.0

- OC29-001: Default SOAP date/time type changed to XML_Date_Time
  Problem: Old version of AWS servers were using XML_Time_Instant, so
           this change makes the default not compatible with old SOAP
           client or server.
  Workaround: Do not use the default, force the Type_Name to be a
              XML_Time_Instant instead of XML_Date_Time.

- OB17-023: Wrong error code returned for broken request line
  Problem: A server internal error code 500 is returned when a
           broken request line is detected.
  Workaround: None.
