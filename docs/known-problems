Known Problems fixed in AWS 3.2

- N731-023: MIME_Types not taken into account
  Problem: The MIME types files specified with AWS.Config.Set.MIME_Types
           was not taken into account.
  Workaround: Load the file explicitly using AWS.Config.Load routine.

- N727-001: WebSocket concurrency issue
  Problem: When using lot of tasks to handle WebSockets the AWS server could
           crashes abruptly.
  Workaround: None.

- N624-001: AWS won't build on Darwin with OpenSSL
  Problem: The link will not succeed because the OpenSSL thin binding does
           not allow for symbols decoration as using Link_Name in the
           import aspects.
  Workaround: Change all Link_Name by External_Name in OpenSSL thin binding.

- N607-007: AWS wsdl2aws crashes with WSDL recursive definitions
  Problem: A WSDL schema can describe recursive definitions. The AWS
           wsdl2aws crashes when parsing such definitions. Instead of
           crashing the tool now properly report the recursive definition
           and exit.
  Workaround: Remove the recursive definition from the WSDL document.

- N303-022: AWS does not support empty WSDL complex types
  Problem: AWS crashes when trying to parse a WSDL complexType
           with a sequence node without any child.
  Workaround: Rewrite the WSDL by removing the empty parameter from the
              operation definition.

- N228-008: Wrong HTTP status code returned for SOAP fault-messages
  Problem: AWS returns the status code 200 for all SOAP messages but
           it is required to be 500 for fault-messages.
  Workaround: None.

- N219-019: Fix Ada code generation with wsdl2ada
  Problem: For a WSDL record with a single field having a name
           corresponding to an Ada keyword, wsdl2ada was generating
           non compilable Ada units.
  Workaround: Rename the WSDL record field in the WSDL.

- N129-029: Better handling for WebSocket abnormal closure
  Problem: When a client close the connection abruptly we now send
           only a On_Error message with the Abnormal_Closure status
           code.
  Workaround: Do not take any action for On_Close message with a
              Protocol_Error status where the message string contains
              "closed by peer".
