Known Problems fixed in AWS 2.11

- L402-023: URL Parsing failed to parse relative paths correctly
  Problem:    URL Parsing in AWS.URL failed to parse relative URLs if the
              first segment contained the character ':'. The first segment was
              then interpreted as a hostname, with a port number or a
              "user:password" part.
  Workaround: Now URL parsing no longer understand URLs like
              "user:pass@host:port/path" as absolute. Those URLs are now going
              to be considered relative paths instead. Equivalent URLs are now
              written in the form "//user:pass@host:port/path".

- KC20-007 : Constraint error in Translator.To_String
  Problem:    When the bounds of the Stream_Element_Array parameter are
              not in Positive'Range a constraint error is raised.
  Workaround: Make sure the bounds of the parameter are in Positive'Range
