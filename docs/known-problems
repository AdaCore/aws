- N129-029: Better handling for WebSocket abonormal closure
  Problem: When a client close the connection abruptly we now send
           only a On_Error message with the Abnormal_Closure status
           code.
  Workaround: Do not take any action for On_Close message with a
              Protocol_Error status where the message string contains
              "closed by peer".
