Known Problems fixed in AWS 3.2

- N219-019: Fix Ada code generation with wsdl2ada
  Problem: For a WSDL record with a single field having a name
           corresponding to an Ada keyword, wsdl2ada was generating
           non compilable Ada units.
  Workaround: Rename the WSDL record field in the WSDL.

- N129-029: Better handling for WebSocket abonormal closure
  Problem: When a client close the connection abruptly we now send
           only a On_Error message with the Abnormal_Closure status
           code.
  Workaround: Do not take any action for On_Close message with a
              Protocol_Error status where the message string contains
              "closed by peer".
