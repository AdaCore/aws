Known Problems fixed in AWS 3.3

- O317-001: Double free of rejected WebSockets
  Problem: When limiting the number of simultaneous connected WebSockets
           (using Config.Set.Max_WebSocket) the server could miss-behave
           because of memory corruption.
  Workaround: Do not limit the number of active WebSockets.

- NB26-001: Wrong code generated by wsdl2aws for arrays/record inside record
  Problem: For an array inside a record which is not directly used as
           a parameter to a SOAP routine the code generated do not
           compile. This only happen when using a specific manually written
           a type package (using -type wsdl2aws option). The issue is that
           there is a missing "+" operator used to convert an array to the
           corresponding safe-pointer.
  Workaround: Add manually the "+" operator into the hand written type package
              then a corresponding use clause into the package using it.
