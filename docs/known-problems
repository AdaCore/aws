- NB26-001: Wrong code generated by wsdl2aws for arrays/record inside record
  Problem: For an array inside a record which is not directly used as
           a parameter to a SOAP routine the code generated do not
           compile. This only happen when using a specific manually written
           a type package (using -type wsdl2aws option). The issue is that
           there is a missing "+" operator used to convert an array to the
           corresponding safe-pointer.
  Workaround: Add manually the "+" operator into the hand written type package
              then a corresponding use clause into the package using it.
