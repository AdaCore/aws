Known Problems fixed in AWS 3.1

- M325-036: Fix memory leak when handling malformed SOAP document
  Problem: If an exception is raised while parsing a malformed SOAP
           document, the corresponding XML tree is not properly freed.
  Workaround: Make sure the SOAP document is valid.

- LB19-029: Max-Age cookie attribute does non conform to RFC-6265
  Problem: Max-Age cookie attribute must be an integral number
           as specified in the RFC-6265 (2011). Note that the
           definition has changed as previous RFCs 2109 (1997) and
           RFC-2965 (2000) were still defining Max-Age as delta-seconds.
  Workaround: Do not use Opera browser which enforces this rule.

- LB06-009: Memory leak in AWS.Client.LDAP.Bind
  Problem:    When the connection is rejected it is not possible to
              reclaim the memory associated with the LDAP structure.
  Workaround: Copy the LDAP structure before calling Bind.
