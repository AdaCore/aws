Known Problems fixed in AWS 3.3

- OA07-026: Cannot override file upload's Last_Modified_Token header
  Problem: A specified Last_Modified_Token in the header of a response
           is always overridden by the server.
  Workaround: None.

- O408-015: Wrong link to AWS documentation in GPS plug-in
  Problem: The AWS and Templates Parser User's Guides where not listed in
           the GPS Help menu.
  Workaround: Open manually the documentation files found in share/doc/aws

- O317-001: Double free of rejected WebSockets
  Problem: When limiting the number of simultaneous connected WebSockets
           (using Config.Set.Max_WebSocket) the server could miss-behave
           because of memory corruption.
  Workaround: Do not limit the number of active WebSockets.

- NB26-001: Wrong code generated by wsdl2aws for arrays/record inside record
  Problem: For an array inside a record which is not directly used as
           a parameter to a SOAP routine the code generated do not
           compile. This only happen when using a specific manually written
           a type package (using -type wsdl2aws option). The issue is that
           there is a missing "+" operator used to convert an array to the
           corresponding safe-pointer.
  Workaround: Add manually the "+" operator into the hand written type package
              then a corresponding use clause into the package using it.
