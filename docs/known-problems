Known Problems fixed in AWS 2.10

- JB05-022: Cannot write more than 2**31 bytes in a compressed stream
  Problem:    With a 32 bits compiler, writing more than 2**31 bytes into a
              compressed stream raises a constraint error.
  Workaround: Use a 64 bits compiler.

- J511-016: Exception raised for Response.File when file does not exist
  Problem:    When a Response.File is send back to the client and the
              actual file does not exist on disk an exception is
              raised. This is not a proper behavior. AWS now returns
              a 404 status code.
  Workaround: Check file existence before calling Response.File
