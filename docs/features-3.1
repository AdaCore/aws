NF-31-M208-025 Support for setting priorities (2013-02-15)

   It is now possible to set the priorities of different tasks used by
   AWS. There are four priority categories supported. One for the HTTP
   server, one for the WebSocket handler, one for the session data
   cleaner task and one for all other optional services (Jabber
   protocol handler, Server Push...).

NF-31-M103-030 Support for certificate checking has been added (2013-01-10)

   Support for certificate checking has been added. The actual status
   code can be retrieved and the corresponding message if needed. It
   is then possible to know why a certificate has been rejected from
   the verify user's callback.
