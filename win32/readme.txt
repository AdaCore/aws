AWS - OpenSSL libraries for Win32
---------------------------------

The libraries distributed here are for GNAT 3.13 for Windows 95/98/NT/2000.

These libraries are not compatible with GNAT 3.12 (or older version), if you
must use GNAT 3.12 you'll have to build the OpenSSL libraries from source. Or
you can download them directly from Dmitriy Anisimkov (anisimkov@yahoo.com)
