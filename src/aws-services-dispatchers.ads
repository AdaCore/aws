package AWS.Services.Dispatchers is

   pragma Pure;

   --  Services on the Dispatcher tree are to help building big servers.
   --  Experiences shows that a lot of user's code is to check the value of a
   --  specific URI or request method to call the right callback that will
   --  handle the request. This code is a big "if/elsif/end if" that just hide
   --  the real job. A dispatcher is to replace this code. Currently there is
   --  three of them:
   --
   --  URI (AWS.Services.Dispatchers.URI)
   --     to dispatch to a callback depending of the ressource name.
   --
   --  Method (AWS.Services.Dispatchers.Method)
   --     to dispatch to a callback depending of the request method.
   --
   --  Virtual_Host (AWS.Services.Dispatchers.Virtual_Host)
   --     to dispatch to a callback depending on the host name. This is known
   --     as virtual hosting and permit to have multiple servers on the same
   --     machine using the same port.
   --
   --  Transient_Pages (AWS.Services.Dispatchers.Transient_Pages)
   --     to handle transient pages, if the default user's callback returns
   --     404 this dispatcher checks if the requested resource is a transient
   --     page.
   --
   --  Timer (AWS.Services.Dispatchers.Timer)
   --     to dispatch to a specific callback depending on the current time.

end AWS.Services.Dispatchers;
