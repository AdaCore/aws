--  The Callback is an implementation of a simple static Web page server. It
--  will return the Web pages found in the Web server directory. If directory
--  browsing is activated, it will be possible to browse directory content if
--  the requested ressource is a directory. There is two specials files that
--  are recognized:
--
--    404.thtml              The Web page returned if the requested page is
--                           not found. This is a template with a single tag
--                           variable named PAGE. It will be replaced by the
--                           ressource which was not found.
--
--                           Note that on Microsoft IE this page will be
--                           displayed only if the total page size is bigger
--                           than 512 bytes or it includes at least one
--                           image.
