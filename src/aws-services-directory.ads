--  This service can be used to browse a file system. The browsing mechanism
--  will gather information (filename, size, directory...) from a specified
--  directory name and will fill a translation table. This table will be used
--  with a template file to render the HTML document. You can design your own
--  browsing template file, here is a description of all tag variables defined
--  in the translation table:
--
--     URI (discrete)
--        The URI pointing to the directory parsed.
--
--     VERSION (discrete)
--        AWS version string.
--
--     IS_DIR_V (vector)
--        A list of booleans, indicate if Nth entry is a directory or not.
--
--     NAME_V (vector)
--        A list of filenames. Nth name is a directory if Nth entry in IS_DIR
--        is set to true.
--
--     SIZE_V (vector)
--        A list of sizes. Nth entry is the file size of the Nth entry in
--        NAMES.
--
--     TIME_V (vector)
--        A list of last modification times. Nth entry is is the last
--        modification time of the Nth entry in NAMES.
--
--     NAME_ORDR
--        Rule to either set ordering on name or to revert current name
--        ordering.
--
--     SNME_ORDR
--        Rule to either set ordering on name (case sensitive) or to revert
--        current name (case sensitive) ordering.
--
--     EXT_ORDR
--        Rule to either set ordering on extension or to revert current
--        extension ordering.
--
--     SEXT_ORDR
--        Rule to either set ordering on extension (case sensitive) or to
--        revert current extension (case sensitive) ordering.
--
--     MIME_ORDR
--        Rule to either set ordering on MIME type or to revert current MIME
--        type ordering.
--
--     DIR_ORDR
--        Rule to either set ordering on directory or to revert current
--        directory ordering.
--
--     SIZE_ORDR
--        Rule to either set ordering on size or to revert current size
--        ordering.
--
--     TIME_ORDR
--        Rule to either set ordering on time or to revert current time
--        ordering.
--
--     ORIG_ORDR
--        Rule to either set original ordering (file order as read on the file
--        system) or to revert current original ordering.
--
--     DIR_NAME_ORDR
--        Rule to either set ordering on directory/name or to revert current
--        directory/name ordering.
--
--     DIR_SNME_ORDR
--        Rule to either set ordering on directory/name (case sensitive) or to
--        revert current directory/name (case sensitive) ordering.
--
--     DIR_TIME_ORDR
--        Rule to either set ordering on directory/time or to revert current
--        directory/time ordering.
