--  This unit implement API to send mail message. It is possible to send
--  simple mail [RFC 821] and mail with MIME attachments [RFC 2045 & 2049].
--
--  How to send a mail:
--
--  1) Initialize a Server to send the messages.
--
--     Wanadoo : SMTP.Server := SMTP.Client.Initialize ("smtp.wanadoo.fr");
--
--  2) Send a message via this server.
--
--     Result : SMTP.Status;
--
--     SMTP.Client.Send
--        (Server  => Wanadoo,
--         From    => SMTP.E_Mail ("Pascal Obry", "p.obry@wanadoo.fr"),
--         To      => SMTP.E_Mail
--                      ("Dmitriy Anisimkov", "anisimkov@omsknet.ru"),
--         Subject => "Latest Ada news",
--         Message => "now Ada can send SMTP mail!",
--         Status  => Result);
