--  This package provides a service to build Callbacks which can support
--  user's data. It is possible to build a new dispatcher by inheriting the
--  handler type and to provides the Dispatch routine.

with AWS.Response;
with AWS.Status;

package AWS.Dispatchers is

   type Handler is abstract new Ada.Finalization.Controlled with private;

   procedure Initialize (Dispatcher : in out Handler);
   procedure Adjust     (Dispatcher : in out Handler);
   procedure Finalize   (Dispatcher : in out Handler);
   --  Initialize/Adjust/Finalize is doing the reference counting, children
   --  should just call these routines if possible. It is possible to know if
   --  no more object are referenced by calling Ref_Counter below.

   function Dispatch
     (Dispatcher : in Handler;
      Request    : in Status.Data)
      return Response.Data is abstract;
   --  Call the appropriate inherited dispatcher

   function Ref_Counter (Dispatcher : in Handler) return Natural;
   --  Returns the reference counter for Handler. If 0 is returned then this
   --  object is not referenced anymore, it is safe to deallocate ressources.

   type Handler_Class_Access is access all Handler'Class;

   procedure Free (Dispatcher : in out Handler_Class_Access);
   pragma Inline (Free);
   --  Release memory associated with the dispatcher

   type Natural_Access is access all Natural;
