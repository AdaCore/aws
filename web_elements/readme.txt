This directory contains a set of ready to use Web design templates.

To ease integration we have used the following design:

- Each directory is self contained and the content must be copied into
  the project. 

- Each graphic elements (icons) is referenced into the templates with the
  alias /we_icons/<icon_name>. So users must provide the right alias 
  ("/we_icons/") in the  Web server.
