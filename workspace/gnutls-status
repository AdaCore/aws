Here are the known regressions on the GNU/TLS support.

cert.adb:
   The client certificate is not sent to the server.

plain2ssl.adb:
   error : A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.

ssto.adb:
   wrong data received.
   -> the problem comes from the fact that the Client socket is first
      on input timeout. The next step is to actually get some data, but
      the next Receice call fails with an input timeout. Reconnecting solve
      the problem. It looks like a wrong reset of the socket state...

ssockto.adb:
   error: Insufficient credentials for that request.

spair_sec.adb:
   no output, and lock.

sockext_sec.adb:
   server/client start and lock.

sockover_sec.adb:
   start and lock.
   timeout problem.
